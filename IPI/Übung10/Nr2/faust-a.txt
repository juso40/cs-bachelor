62: Part I: Dedication
63: 
64: Again you show yourselves, you wavering Forms,
65: Revealed, as you once were, to clouded vision.
66: Shall I attempt to hold you fast once more?
67: Heart’s willing still to suffer that illusion?
68: You crowd so near! Well then, you shall endure,         5
69: And rouse me, from your mist and cloud’s confusion:
70: My spirit feels so young again: it’s shaken
71: By magic breezes that your breathings waken.
72: 
73: You bring with you the sight of joyful days,
74: And many a loved shade rises to the eye:               10
75: And like some other half-forgotten phrase,
76: First Love returns, and Friendship too is nigh:
77: Pain is renewed, and sorrow: all the ways,
78: Life wanders in its labyrinthine flight,
79: Naming the good, those that Fate has robbed            15
80: Of lovely hours, those slipped from me and lost.
81: 
82: They can no longer hear this latest song,
83: Spirits, to whom I gave my early singing:
84: That kindly crowd itself is now long gone,
85: Alas, it dies away, that first loud ringing!           20
86: I bring my verses to the unknown throng,
87: My heart’s made anxious even by their clapping,
88: And those besides delighted by my verse,
89: If they still live, are scattered through the Earth.
90: 
91: I feel a long and unresolved desire                    25
92: For that serene and solemn land of ghosts:
93: It quivers now, like an Aeolian lyre,
94: My stuttering verse, with its uncertain notes,
95: A shudder takes me: tear on tear, entire,
96: The firm heart feels weakened and remote:              30
97: What I possess seems far away from me,
98: And what is gone becomes reality.
99: Part I: Prelude On Stage
100: 
101: (Director, Dramatist, Comedian)
102: 
103: Director
104: 
105: You two, who’ve often stood by me,
106: In times of need, when trouble’s breaking,
107: Say what success our undertaking                  35
108: Will meet with, then, in Germany?
109: I’d rather like the crowd to enjoy it,
110: Since they live and let live, truly.
111: The stage is set, the boards complete,
112: And they await our festivity.                     40
113: They’re seated already, eyebrows raised,
114: Calmly hoping they’ll be amazed.
115: I know how to make the people happy:
116: But I’ve never been so embarrassed: not
117: That they’ve been used to the best, you see,      45
118: Yet they’ve all read such a dreadful lot.
119: How can we make it all seem fresh and new,
120: Weighty, but entertaining too?
121: I’d love to see a joyful crowd, that’s certain,
122: When the waves drive them to our place,           50
123: And with tremendous and repeated surging,
124: Squeeze them through the narrow gate of grace:
125: In the light of day they’re there already,
126: Pushing, till they’ve reached the window,
127: As if they’re at the baker’s, starving, nearly    55
128: Breaking their necks: just for a ticket. Oh!
129: Only poets can work this miracle on men
130: So various: the day is yours, my friend!
131: Dramatist
132: 
133: O, don’t speak to me of that varied crew,
134: The sight of whom makes inspiration fade.         60
135: Veil, from me, the surging multitude,
136: Whose whirling will drives us everyway.
137: No, some heavenly silence lead me to,
138: Where for the poet alone pure joy’s at play:
139: Where Love and Friendship too grace our hearts,   65
140: Created and inspired by heavenly arts.
141: 
142: Ah! What springs here from our deepest being,
143: What the shy trembling lips in speaking meant,
144: Now falling awry, and now perhaps succeeding,
145: Is swallowed in the fierce Moment’s violence.     70
146: Often, when the first years are done, unseeing,
147: It appears at last, complete, in deepest sense.
148: What dazzles is a Momentary act:
149: What’s true is left for posterity, intact.
150: 
151: Comedian
152: 
153: Don’t speak about posterity to me!                75
154: If I went on about posterity,
155: Where would you get your worldly fun?
156: Folk want it, and they’ll still have some.
157: The presence of a fine young man
158: Is nice, I think, for everyone.                   80
159: Who, comfortably, shares his wit,
160: And to their moods takes no exception:
161: He’ll make himself a greater hit,
162: And win a more secure reception.
163: Be brave, and show them what you’ve got,          85
164: Have Fantasy with all her chorus, yes,
165: Mind, Reason, Passion, Tears, the lot,
166: But don’t you leave out Foolishness.
167: Director
168: 
169: Make sure, above all, plenty’s happening there!
170: They come to look, and then they want to stare.         90
171: Spin endlessly before their faces,
172: So the people gape amazed,
173: You’ve won them by your many paces,
174: You’ll be the man most praised.
175: The mass are only moved by things en masse,             95
176: Each one, himself, will choose the bit he needs:
177: Who brings a lot, brings something that will pass:
178: And everyone goes home contentedly.
179: You’ll give a piece, why then give it them in pieces!
180: With such a stew you’re destined for success.           100
181: Easy to serve, it’s as easy to invent.
182: What use to bring them your complete intent?
183: The Public will soon pick at what you’ve dressed.
184: 
185: Dramatist
186: 
187: You don’t see how badly such work will do!
188: How little it suits the genuine creator!                105
189: Already, I see, it’s a principle with you.
190: The finest master is a sloppy worker.
191: 
192: Director
193: 
194: Such a reproach leaves me unmoved:
195: The man who seeks to be approved,
196: Must stick to the best tools for it,                    110
197: Think, soft wood’s the best to split,
198: And have a look for whom you write!
199: See, this is one that boredom drives,
200: Another’s from some overloaded table,
201: Or, worst of all, he’s one arrives,                     115
202: Like most, fresh from the daily paper.
203: They rush here mindlessly, as to a Masque,
204: And curiosity inspires their hurry:
205: The ladies bring themselves, and in their best,
206: Come and play their parts and ask no fee.        120
207: What dream of yours is this, exalted verse?
208: Doesn’t a full house make you happy?
209: Have a good look at your patrons first!
210: One half are coarse, the rest are chilly.
211: After the show he hopes for card-play:           125
212: He hopes for a wild night, and a woman’s kiss.
213: Why then do so many poor fools plague,
214: The sweet Muse, for such a goal as this?
215: I tell you, just give them more and more,
216: So you’ll never stray far from the mark,         130
217: Just seek to confuse them, in the dark:
218: To keep them happy, that’s hard - for sure.
219: And now what’s wrong? Delight or Pain?
220: Dramatist
221: 
222: Go, look for another scribbler by night!
223: Shall the poet throw away the highest right,         135
224: The right of humanity, that Nature gave,
225: Carelessly, so that you might gain!
226: How will he move all hearts again?
227: How will each element be his slave?
228: Is that harmony nothing, from his breast unfurled,   140
229: That draws back into his own heart, the world?
230: When Nature winds the lengthened filaments,
231: Indifferently, on her eternal spindle,
232: When all the tuneless mass of elements,
233: In their sullen discord, jar and jangle –            145
234: Who parts the ever-flowing ranks of creation,
235: Stirs them, so rhythmic measure is assured?
236: Who calls the One to general ordination,
237: Where it may ring in marvellous accord?
238: Who lets the storm wind rage with passion,           150
239: The sunset glow the senses move?
240: Who scatters every lovely springtime blossom
241: Beneath the footsteps of the one we love?
242: Who weaves the slight green wreath of leaves,
243: To honour work well done in every art?               155
244: What makes Olympus sure, joins deities?
245: The power of Man, revealed by the bard.
246: Comedian
247: 
248: So use it then, all this fine energy,
249: And drive along the work of poetry,
250: To show how we are driven in Love’s play.          160
251: By chance we meet, we feel, we stay,
252: And bit by bit we’re tightly bound:
253: Happiness grows, and then it’s fenced around:
254: We’re all inflamed then comes the sorrowing:
255: Before you know it, there’s a novel brewing!       165
256: Why don’t we give such a piece!
257: Grasp the life of man complete!
258: Everyone lives, though it’s seldom confessed,
259: And wherever you grasp, there’s interest.
260: In varied pictures there’s little light,           170
261: A lot of error, and a gleam of right,
262: So the best of drinks is brewed,
263: So the world’s cheered and renewed.
264: Then see the flower of lovely youth collect,
265: To hear your words, and view the offering,         175
266: And every tender nature will extract
267: A melancholy food from what you bring,
268: They’ll gain now this and that from your art,
269: So each sees what is present in their heart.
270: They’re readily moved to weeping or to laughter,   180
271: They’ll admire your verve, and enjoy the show:
272: What’s finished you can never alter after:
273: Minds still in growth will be grateful, though.
274: Dramatist
275: 
276: So give me back that time again,
277: When I was still ‘becoming’,                 185
278: When words gushed like a fountain
279: In new, and endless flowing,
280: Then for me mists veiled the world,
281: In every bud the wonder glowed,
282: A thousand flowers I unfurled,               190
283: That every valley, richly, showed.
284: I had nothing, yet enough:
285: Joy in illusion, thirst for truth.
286: Give every passion, free to move,
287: The deepest bliss, filled with pain,         195
288: The force of hate, the power of love,
289: Oh, give me back my youth again!
290: 
291: Comedian
292: 
293: Youth is what you need, dear friend,
294: When enemies jostle you, of course,
295: And girls, filled with desire, bend          200
296: Their arms around your neck, with force,
297: When the swift-run race’s garland
298: Beckons from the hard-won goal,
299: When from the swirling dance, a man
300: Drinks until the night is old.               205
301: But to play that well-known lyre
302: With courage and with grace,
303: Moved by self-imposed desire,
304: At a sweet wandering pace,
305: That is your function, Age,                  210
306: And our respect won’t lessen.
307: Age doesn’t make us childish, as they say,
308: It finds that we’re still children.
309: 
310: Director
311: 
312: That’s enough words for the moment,
313: Now let me see some action!                 215
314: While you’re handing out the compliments,
315: You should also make things happen.
316: Why talk so much of inspiration?
317: Delay won’t make it flow, you see.
318: Since Poetry gave the gift of creation,     220
319: Take your orders then from Poetry.
320: You know what’s wanted here,
321: We need strong ale to appear:
322: So brew me a barrel right away!
323: Tomorrow won’t do what’s undone today,      225
324: We shouldn’t waste a minute, so
325: Decide what’s possible, and just
326: Grasp it firmly like a hoe,
327: Make sure that you let nothing go,
328: And work it about, because you must.        230
329: On the German stage, you see,
330: Everyone tries out what he can:
331: Don’t fail to show me, I’m your man,
332: Your trap-doors, and your scenery.
333: Use heavenly lights, the big and small,     235
334: Squander stars in any number,
335: Rocky cliffs, and fire, and water,
336: Birds and creatures, use them all.
337: So in our narrow playhouse waken
338: The whole wide circle of creation,          240
339: And stride, deliberately, as well,
340: From Heaven, through the world, to Hell.
341: Part I: Prologue In Heaven
342: 
343: (God, the Heavenly Hosts, and then Mephistopheles.)
344: 
345: (The Three Archangels step forward.)
346: 
347: Raphael
348: 
349: The Sun sings out, in ancient mode,
350: His note among his brother-spheres,
351: And ends his pre-determined road,                     245
352: With peals of thunder for our ears.
353: The sight of him gives Angels power,
354: Though none can understand the way:
355: The inconceivable work is ours,
356: As bright as on the primal day.                       250
357: 
358: 
359: Gabriel
360: 
361: And swift, and swift, beyond conceiving,
362: The splendour of the Earth turns round,
363: A Paradisial light is interleaving,
364: With night’s awesome profound.
365: The ocean breaks with shining foam,                   255
366: Against the rocky cliffs deep base,
367: And rock and ocean whirl and go,
368: In the spheres’ swift eternal race.
369: 
370: Michael
371: 
372: And storms are roaring in their race
373: From sea to land, and land to sea,                    260
374: Their raging forms a fierce embrace,
375: All round, of deepest energy.
376: The lightning’s devastations blaze
377: Along the thunder-crashes’ way:
378: Yet, Lord, your messengers, shall praise              265
379: The gentle passage of your day.
380: All Three
381: 
382: The sight of it gives Angels power
383: Though none can understand the way,
384: And all your noble work is ours,
385: As bright as on the primal day.                         270
386: 
387: Mephistopheles
388: 
389: Since, O Lord, you near me once again,
390: To ask how all below is doing now,
391: And usually receive me without pain,
392: You see me too among the vile crowd.
393: Forgive me: I can’t speak in noble style,               275
394: And since I’m still reviled by this whole crew,
395: My pathos would be sure to make you smile,
396: If you had not renounced all laughter too.
397: You’ll get no word of suns and worlds from me.
398: How men torment themselves is all I see.                280
399: The little god of Earth sticks to the same old way,
400: And is as strange as on that very first day.
401: He might appreciate life a little more: he might,
402: If you hadn’t lent him a gleam of Heavenly light:
403: He calls it Reason, but only uses it                    285
404: To be more a beast than any beast as yet.
405: He seems to me, saving Your Grace,
406: Like a long-legged grasshopper: through space
407: He’s always flying: he flies and then he springs,
408: And in the grass the same old song he sings.            290
409: If he’d just lie there in the grass it wouldn’t hurt!
410: But he buries his nose in every piece of dirt.
411: 
412: God
413: 
414: Have you nothing else to name?
415: Do you always come here to complain?
416: Does nothing ever go right on the Earth?                295
417: Mephistopheles
418: 
419: No, Lord! I find, as always, it couldn’t be worse.
420: I’m so involved with Man’s wretched ways,
421: I’ve even stopped plaguing them, myself, these days.
422: 
423: God
424: 
425: Do you know, Faust?
426: 
427: Mephistopheles
428: 
429:                           The Doctor?
430: 
431: God
432:                                         My servant, first!
433: 
434: Mephistopheles
435: 
436: In truth! He serves you in a peculiar manner.                300
437: There’s no earthly food or drink at that fool’s dinner.
438: He drives his spirit outwards, far,
439: Half-conscious of its maddened dart:
440: From Heaven demands the brightest star,
441: And from the Earth, Joy’s highest art,                       305
442: And all the near and all the far,
443: Fails to release his throbbing heart.
444: 
445: God
446: 
447: Though he’s still confused at how to serve me,
448: I’ll soon lead him to a clearer dawning,
449: In the green sapling, can’t the gardener see                 310
450: The flowers and fruit the coming years will bring.
451: Mephistopheles
452: 
453: What do you wager? I might win him yet!
454: If you give me your permission first,
455: I’ll lead him gently on the road I set.
456: 
457: God
458: 
459: As long as he’s alive on Earth,                315
460: So long as that I won’t forbid it,
461: For while man strives he errs.
462: 
463: Mephistopheles
464: 
465: My thanks: I’ve never willingly seen fit
466: To spend my time amongst the dead,
467: I much prefer fresh cheeks instead.            320
468: To corpses, I close up my house:
469: Or it’s too like a cat with a mouse.
470: 
471: God
472: 
473: Well and good, you’ve said what’s needed!
474: Divert this spirit from his source,
475: You know how to trap him, lead him,
476: On your downward course,                       325
477: And when you must, then stand, amazed:
478: A good man, in his darkest yearning,
479: Is still aware of virtue’s ways.
480: 
481: Mephistopheles
482: 
483: That’s fine! There’s hardly any waiting.       330
484: My wager’s more than safe I’m thinking.
485: When I achieve my goal, in winning,
486: You’ll let me triumph with a swelling heart.
487: He’ll eat the dust, and with an art,
488: Like the snake my mother, known for sinning.   335
489: God
490: 
491: You can appear freely too:
492: Those like you I’ve never hated.
493: Of all the spirits who deny, it’s you,
494: The jester, who’s most lightly weighted.
495: Man’s energies all too soon seek the level,              340
496: He quickly desires unbroken slumber,
497: So I gave him you to join the number,
498: To move, and work, and play the devil.
499: But you the genuine sons of light,
500: Enjoy the living beauty bright!                          345
501: Becoming, that works and lives forever,
502: Embrace you in love’s limits dear,
503: And all that may as Appearance waver,
504: Fix firmly with everlasting Idea!
505: 
506: (Heaven closes, and the Archangels separate.)
507: 
508: Mephistopheles (alone)
509: 
510: I like to hear the Old Man’s words, from time to time,   350
511: And take care, when I’m with him, not to spew.
512: It’s very nice when such a great Gentleman,
513: Chats with the devil, in ways so human, too!
514: Part I Scene I: Night
515: 
516: (In a high-vaulted Gothic chamber, Faust, in a chair at his desk, restless.)
517: 
518: Ah! Now I’ve done Philosophy,
519: I’ve finished Law and Medicine,                                         355
520: And sadly even Theology:
521: Taken fierce pains, from end to end.
522: Now here I am, a fool for sure!
523: No wiser than I was before:
524: Master, Doctor’s what they call me,                                     360
525: And I’ve been ten years, already,
526: Crosswise, arcing, to and fro,
527: Leading my students by the nose,
528: And see that we can know - nothing!
529: It almost sets my heart burning.                                        365
530: I’m cleverer than all these teachers,
531: Doctors, Masters, scribes, preachers:
532: I’m not plagued by doubt or scruple,
533: Scared by neither Hell nor Devil –
534: Instead all Joy is snatched away,                                       370
535: What’s worth knowing, I can’t say,
536: I can’t say what I should teach
537: To make men better or convert each.
538: And then I’ve neither goods nor gold,
539: No worldly honour, or splendour hold:                                   375
540: Not even a dog would play this part!
541: So I’ve given myself to Magic art,
542: To see if, through Spirit powers and lips,
543: I might have all secrets at my fingertips.
544: And no longer, with rancid sweat, so,                                   380
545: Still have to speak what I cannot know:
546: That I may understand whatever
547: Binds the world’s innermost core together,
548: See all its workings, and its seeds,
549: Deal no more in words’ empty reeds.                                     385
550: O, may you look, full moon that shines,
551: On my pain for this last time:
552: So many midnights from my desk,
553: I have seen you, keeping watch:
554: When over my books and paper,                    390
555: Saddest friend, you appear!
556: Ah! If on the mountain height
557: I might stand in your sweet light,
558: Float with spirits in mountain caves,
559: Swim the meadows in twilight’ waves,             395
560: Free from the smoke of knowledge too,
561: Bathe in your health-giving dew!
562: Alas! In this prison must I stick?
563: This hollow darkened hole of brick,
564: Where even the lovely heavenly light             400
565: Shines through stained glass, dull not bright.
566: Hemmed in, by heaps of books,
567: Piled to the highest vault, and higher,
568: Worm eaten, decked with dust,
569: Surrounded by smoke-blackened paper,             405
570: Glass vials, boxes round me, hurled,
571: Stuffed with Instruments thrown together,
572: Packed with ancestral lumber –
573: This is my world! And what a world!
574: And need you ask why my heart                    410
575: Makes such tremors in my breast?
576: Why all my life-energies are
577: Choked by some unknown distress?
578: Smoke and mildew hem me in,
579: Instead of living Nature, then,                  415
580: Where God once created Men,
581: Bones of creatures, and dead limbs!
582: Fly! Upwards! Into Space, flung wide!
583: Isn’t this book, with secrets crammed,
584: From Nostradamus’ very hand,                     420
585: Enough to be my guide?
586: When I know the starry road,
587: And Nature, you instruct me,
588: My soul’s power, you shall flow,
589: As spirits can with spirits be.                  425
590: Useless, this dusty pondering here
591: To read the sacred characters:
592: Soar round me, Spirits, and be near:
593: If you hear me, then answer!
594: (He opens the Book, and sees the Symbol of the Macrocosm)
595: 
596: Ah! In a moment, what bliss flows                                   430
597: Through my senses from this Sign!
598: I feel life’s youthful, holy joy: it glows,
599: Fresh in every nerve and vein of mine.
600: This symbol now that calms my inward raging,
601: Perhaps a god deigned to write,                                     435
602: Filling my poor heart with delight,
603: And with its mysterious urging
604: Revealing, round me, Nature’s might?
605: Am I a god? All seems so clear to me!
606: It seems the deepest works of Nature                                440
607: Lie open to my soul, with purest feature.
608: Now I understand what wise men see:
609: “The world of spirits is not closed:
610: Your senses are: your heart is dead!
611: Rise, unwearied, disciple: bathe instead                            445
612: Your earthly breast in the morning’s glow!”
613: 
614: (He gazes at the Symbol.)
615: 
616: How each to the Whole its selfhood gives,
617: One in another works and lives!
618: How Heavenly forces fall and rise,
619: Golden vessels pass each other by!                                  450
620: Blessings from their wings disperse:
621: They penetrate from Heaven to Earth,
622: Sounding a harmony through the Universe!
623: Such a picture! Ah, alas! Merely a picture!
624: How then can I grasp you endless Nature?                            455
625: Where are your breasts that pour out Life entire,
626: To which the Earth and Heavens cling so,
627: Where withered hearts would drink? You flow
628: You nourish, yet I languish so, in vain desire.
629: 
630: (He strikes the book indignantly, and catches sight of the Symbol
631: of the Earth-Spirit.)
632: How differently it works on me, this Sign!                           460
633: You, the Spirit of Earth, are nearer:
634: Already, I feel my power is greater,
635: Already, I glow, as with fresh wine.
636: I feel the courage to engage the world,
637: Into the pain and joy of Earth be hurled,                            465
638: And though the storm wind is unfurled,
639: Fearless, in the shipwreck’s teeth, be whirled.
640: There’s cloud above me –
641: The Moon hides its light –
642: The lamp flickers!
643: Now it dies! Crimson rays dart                                       470
644: Round my head – Horror
645: Flickers from the vault above,
646: And grips me tight!
647: I feel you float around me,                                          475
648: Spirit, I summon to appear, speak to me!
649: Ah! What tears now at the core of me!
650: All my senses reeling
651: With fresh feeling!
652: I feel you draw my whole heart towards you!                          480
653: You must! You must! Though my Life’s lost, too!
654: 
655: (He grips the book and speaks the mysterious name of the Spirit. A crimson
656: flame flashes, the Spirit appears in the flame.)
657: 
658: Spirit
659: 
660: Who calls me?
661: 
662: Faust (Looking away)
663: 
664:                          Terrible to gaze at!
665: 
666: Spirit
667: 
668: Mightily you have drawn me to you,
669: Long, from my sphere, snatched your food,
670: And now –
671: Faust
672: 
673:                    Ah! Endure you, I cannot!                485
674: 
675: Spirit
676: 
677: You beg me to show myself, you implore,
678: You wish to hear my voice, and see my face:
679: The mighty prayer of your soul weighs
680: With me, I am here! – What wretched terror
681: Grips you, the Superhuman! Where is your soul’s calling?    490
682: Where is the heart that made a world inside, enthralling:
683: Carried it, nourished it, swollen with joy, so tremulous,
684: That you too might be a Spirit, one of us?
685: Where are you, Faust, whose ringing voice
686: Drew towards me with all your force?                        495
687: Are you he, who, breathing my breath,
688: Trembles in all your life’s depths,
689: A fearful, writhing worm?
690: 
691: Faust
692: 
693: Shall I fear you: you form of fire?
694: I am, I am Faust: I am your peer!                           500
695: 
696: Spirit
697: 
698: In Life’s wave, in action’s storm,
699: I float, up and down,
700: I blow, to and fro!
701: Birth and the tomb,
702: An eternal flow,                                            505
703: A woven changing,
704: A glow of Being.
705: Over Time’s quivering loom intent,
706: Working the Godhead’s living garment.
707: 
708: Faust
709: 
710: You who wander the world, on every hand,                    510
711: Active Spirit, how close to you I feel!
712: 
713: Spirit
714: 
715: You’re like the Spirit that you understand
716: Not me!
717: 
718: (It vanishes.)
719: 
720: Faust (Overwhelmed)
721: 
722: Not you?
723: Who then?                                                           515
724: I, the image of the Godhead!
725: Not even like you?
726: 
727: (A knock.)
728: 
729: Oh, fate! I know that sound – it’s my attendant –
730: My greatest fortune’s ruined!
731: In all the fullness of my doing,                                    520
732: He must intrude, that arid pedant!
733: 
734: (Wagner enters, in gown and nightcap, lamp in hand. Faust turns to him
735: impatiently.)
736: 
737: Wagner
738: 
739: Forgive me! But I heard you declaim:
740: Reading, I’m sure, from some Greek tragedy?
741: To profit from that art is my aim,
742: Nowadays it goes down splendidly.                                   525
743: I’ve often heard it claimed, you see
744: A priest could learn from the Old Comedy.
745: 
746: Faust
747: 
748: Yes, when the priest’s a comedian already:
749: Which might well seem to be the case.
750: Wagner
751: 
752: Ah! When a man’s so penned in his study,          530
753: And scarcely sees the world on holidays,
754: And barely through the glass, and far off then,
755: How can he lead men, through persuading them?
756: 
757: Faust
758: 
759: You can’t, if you can’t feel it, if it never
760: Rises from the soul, and sways                    535
761: The heart of every single hearer,
762: With deepest power, in simple ways.
763: You’ll sit forever, gluing things together,
764: Cooking up a stew from other’s scraps,
765: Blowing on a miserable fire,                      540
766: Made from your heap of dying ash.
767: Let apes and children praise your art,
768: If their admiration’s to your taste,
769: But you’ll never speak from heart to heart,
770: Unless it rises up from your heart’s space.       545
771: Wagner
772: 
773: Still, lecturing brings orators success:
774: I feel that I am far behind the rest.
775: 
776: Faust
777: 
778: Seek to profit honestly!
779: Don’t be an empty tinkling fool!
780: Understanding, and true clarity,              550
781: Express themselves without art’s rule!
782: And if you mean what you say,
783: Why hunt for words, anyway?
784: Yes, your speech, that glitters so,
785: Where you gather scraps for Man,              555
786: Is dead as the mist-filled winds that blow
787: Through the dried-up leaves of autumn!
788: 
789: Wagner
790: 
791: Oh, God! Art is long
792: And life is short.
793: Often the studies that I’m working on         560
794: Make me anxious, in my head and heart.
795: How hard it is to command the means
796: By which a man attains the very source!
797: Before a man has travelled half his course,
798: The wretched devil has to die it seems.       565
799: 
800: Faust
801: 
802: Parchment then, is that your holy well,
803: From which drink always slakes your thirst?
804: You’ll never truly be refreshed until
805: It pours itself from your own soul, first.
806: Wagner
807: 
808: Pardon me, but it’s a great delight                    570
809: When, moved by the spirit of the ages, we have sight
810: Of how a wiser man has thought, and how
811: Widely at last we’ve spread his word about.
812: 
813: Faust
814: 
815: Oh yes, as widely as the constellations!
816: My friend, all of the ages that are gone               575
817: Now make up a book with seven seals.
818: The spirit of the ages, that you find,
819: In the end, is the spirit of Humankind:
820: A mirror where all the ages are revealed.
821: And so often it’s all a mere misery                    580
822: Something we run away from at first sight.
823: A pile of sweepings, a lumber room, maybe
824: At best, a puppet show, that’s bright
825: With maxims, excellent, pragmatic,
826: Suitable when dolls’ mouths wax dramatic!              585
827: 
828: Wagner
829: 
830: But, the world! Men’s hearts and minds!
831: Something of those, at least, I’d like to know.
832: 
833: Faust
834: 
835: Yes, what men choose to understand!
836: Who dares to name the child’s real name, though?
837: The few who knew what might be learned,                590
838: Foolish enough to put their whole heart on show,
839: And reveal their feelings to the crowd below,
840: Mankind has always crucified and burned.
841: I beg you, friend, it’s now the dead of night,
842: We must break up this conversation.                    595
843: Wagner
844: 
845: I would have watched with you, if I might
846: Speak with you still, so learned in oration.
847: But tomorrow, on Easter’s first holy day,
848: I’ll ask my several questions, if I may.
849: I’ve pursued my work, zealously studying:          600
850: There’s much I know: yet I’d know everything.
851: (He leaves.)
852: 
853: Faust (Alone.)
854: 
855: That mind alone never loses hope,
856: That keeps to the shallows eternally,
857: Grabs, with eager hand, the wealth it sees,
858: And rejoices at the worms for which it gropes!     605
859: Dare such a human voice echo, too,
860: Where this depth of Spirit surrounds me?
861: Ah yet! For just this once, my thanks to you,
862: You sorriest of all earth’s progeny!
863: You’ve torn me away from that despair,             610
864: That would have soon overwhelmed my senses.
865: Ah! The apparition was so hugely there,
866: It might have truly dwarfed my defences.
867: I, image of the Godhead, already one,
868: Who thought the spirit of eternal truth so near,   615
869: Enjoying the light, both heavenly and clear,
870: Setting to one side the earthbound man:
871: I, more than Angel, a free force,
872: Ready to flow through Nature’s veins,
873: And, in creating, enjoy the life divine,           620
874: Pulsing with ideas: must atone again!
875: A word like thunder swept me away.
876: I dare not measure myself against you.
877: I possessed the power to summon you,
878: But not the power to make you stay.                625
879: In that blissful moment, then
880: I felt myself so small, so great:
881: Cruelly you hurled me back again,
882: Into Man’s uncertain state.
883: What shall I learn from? Or leave?                   630
884: Shall I obey that yearning?
885: Ah! Our actions, and not just our grief,
886: Impede us on life’s journey.
887: Some more and more alien substance presses
888: On the splendour that the Mind conceives:            635
889: And when we gain what this world possesses,
890: We say the better world’s dream deceives.
891: The splendid feelings that give us life,
892: Fade among the crowd’s earthly strife.
893: If imagination flew with courage, once,              640
894: And, full of hope, stretched out to eternity,
895: Now a little room is quite enough,
896: When joy on joy has gone, in time’s whirling sea.
897: Care has nested in the heart’s depths,
898: Restless, she rocks there, spoiling joy and rest,    645
899: There she works her secret pain,
900: And wears new masks, ever and again,
901: Appears as wife and child, fields and houses,
902: As water, fire, or knife or poison:
903: Still we tremble for what never strikes us,          650
904: And must still cry for what has not yet gone.
905: I am no god: I feel it all too deeply.
906: I am the worm that writhes in dust: see,
907: As in the dust it lives, and seeks to eat,
908: It’s crushed and buried by the passing feet.         655
909: Is this not dust, what these vaults hold,
910: These hundred shelves that cramp me:
911: This junk, and all the thousand-fold
912: Shapes, of a moth-ridden world, around me?
913: Will I find here what I’m lacking else,              660
914: Shall I read, perhaps, as a thousand books insist,
915: That Mankind everywhere torments itself,
916: So, here and there, some happy man exists?
917: What do you say to me, bare grinning skull?
918: Except that once your brain whirled like mine,       665
919: Sought the clear day, and in the twilight dull,
920: With a breath of truth, went wretchedly awry.
921: For sure, you instruments mock at me,
922: With cylinders and arms, wheels and cogs:
923: I stand at the door: and you should be the key:   670
924: You’re deftly cut, but you undo no locks.
925: Mysterious, even in broad daylight,
926: Nature won’t let her veil be raised:
927: What your spirit can’t bring to sight,
928: Won’t by screws and levers be displayed.          675
929: You, ancient tools, I’ve never used
930: You’re here because my father used you,
931: Ancient scroll, you’ve darkened too,
932: From smoking candles burned above you.
933: Better the little I had was squandered,           680
934: Than sweat here under its puny weight!
935: What from your father you’ve inherited,
936: You must earn again, to own it straight.
937: What’s never used, leaves us overburdened,
938: But we can use what the Moment may create!        685
939: Yet why does that place so draw my sight,
940: Is that flask a magnet for my gaze?
941: Why is there suddenly so sweet a light,
942: As moonlight in a midnight woodland plays?
943: I salute you, phial of rare potion,               690
944: I lift you down, with devotion!
945: In you I worship man’s art and mind,
946: Embodiment of sweet sleeping draughts:
947: Extract, with deadly power, refined,
948: Show your master all his craft!                   695
949: I see you, and my pain diminishes,
950: I grasp you, and my struggles grow less,
951: My spirit’s flood tide ebbs, more and more,
952: I seem to be where ocean waters meet,
953: A glassy flood gleams around my feet,             700
954: New day invites me to a newer shore.
955: A fiery chariot sweeps nearer
956: On light wings! I feel ready, free
957: To cut a new path through the ether
958: And reach new spheres of pure activity.           705
959: This greater life, this godlike bliss!
960: You, but a worm, have you earned this?
961: Choosing to turn your back, ah yes,
962: On all Earth’s lovely Sun might promise!
963: Let me dare to throw those gates open,            710
964: That other men go creeping by!
965: Now’s the time, to prove through action
966: Man’s dignity may rise divinely high,
967: Never trembling at that void where,
968: Imagination damns itself to pain,                 715
969: Striving towards the passage there,
970: Round whose mouth all Hell’s fires flame:
971: Choose to take that step, happy to go
972: Where danger lies, where Nothingness may flow.
973: Come here to me, cup of crystal, clear!           720
974: Free of your ancient cover now appear,
975: You whom I’ve never, for many a year,
976: Considered! You shone at ancestral feasts,
977: Cheering the over-serious guests:
978: One man passing you to another here.              725
979: It was the drinker’s duty to explain in rhyme
980: The splendour of your many carved designs
981: Or drain it at a draught, and breathe, in time:
982: You remind me of those youthful nights of mine.
983: Now I will never pass you to a friend,            730
984: Or test my wits on your art again.
985: Here’s a juice will stun any man born:
986: It fills your hollow with a browner liquid.
987: I prepared it, now I choose the fluid,
988: At last I drink, and with my soul I bid           735
989: A high and festive greeting to the Dawn!
990: 
991: (He puts the cup to his mouth.)
992: 
993: (Bells chime and a choir sings.)
994: 
995: Choir of Angels
996: 
997: Christ has arisen!
998: Joy to the One, of us,
999: Who the pernicious,
1000: Ancestral, insidious,                             740
1001: Fault has unwoven.
1002: Faust
1003: 
1004: What deep humming, what shining sound
1005: Strikes the glass from my hand with power?
1006: Already, do the hollow bells resound,
1007: Proclaiming Easter’s festive course? Our                     745
1008: Choirs, do you already sing the hymn of consolation,
1009: Which once rang out, in deathly night, in Angels’ oration,
1010: That certainty of a new testament’s hour?
1011: 
1012: Chorus of Women
1013: 
1014: With pure spices
1015: We embalmed him,                                             750
1016: We his faithful
1017: We entombed him:
1018: Linen and bindings,
1019: We unwound there,
1020: Ah! Now we find                                              755
1021: Christ is not here.
1022: 
1023: Choir of Angels
1024: 
1025: Christ has arisen!
1026: Blissful Beloved,
1027: Out of what grieved,
1028: Tested, and healed:                                          760
1029: His trial is won.
1030: 
1031: Faust
1032: 
1033: You heavenly sounds, powerful and mild,
1034: Why, in the dust, here, do you seek me?
1035: Ring out where tender hearts are reconciled.
1036: I hear your message, but faith fails me:                     765
1037: The marvellous is faith’s dearest child.
1038: I don’t attempt to rise to that sphere,
1039: From which the message rings:
1040: Yet I know from childhood what it sings,
1041: And I’m recalled to life once more.                          770
1042: In other times a Heavenly kiss would fall
1043: On me, in the deep Sabbath silence:
1044: The bell notes filled with presentiments,
1045: And a prayer was pleasure’s call:
1046: A sweet yearning, beyond my understanding,   775
1047: Set me wandering through woods and fields,
1048: And while a thousand tears were burning
1049: I felt a world around me come to be.
1050: Love called out the lively games of youth,
1051: The joy of spring’s idle holiday:            780
1052: Memory’s childish feelings, in truth,
1053: Hold me back from the last sombre way.
1054: O, sing on you sweet songs of Heaven!
1055: My tears flow, Earth claims me again!
1056: 
1057: Chorus of Disciples
1058: 
1059: Has the buried one                           785
1060: Already, living,
1061: Raised himself, alone,
1062: Splendidly soaring:
1063: Is he, in teeming air,
1064: Near to creative bliss:                      790
1065: Ah! In sorrow, we’re
1066: Here on Earth’s breast.
1067: Lacking Him, we
1068: Languish, and sigh.
1069: Ah! Master we                                795
1070: Cry for your joy!
1071: 
1072: Choir of Angels
1073: 
1074: Christ has arisen
1075: Out of corruption’s sea.
1076: Tear off your bindings
1077: Joyfully free!                               800
1078: Actively praising him,
1079: Lovingly claiming him,
1080: Fraternally aiding him,
1081: Prayerfully journeying,
1082: Joyfully promising,      805
1083: So is the Master near,
1084: So is he here!
1085: Part I Scene II: In Front Of The City-Gate
1086: 
1087: (Passers-by of all kinds appear.)
1088: 
1089: Several Apprentices
1090: 
1091: So, then, where are you away to?
1092: 
1093: Others
1094: 
1095: We’re away to the Hunting Lodge.
1096: 
1097: The Former
1098: 
1099: We’re off to saunter by the Mill.                810
1100: 
1101: An Apprentice
1102: 
1103: Off to the Riverside Inn, I’d guess.
1104: 
1105: A Second Apprentice
1106: 
1107: The way there’s not of the best.
1108: 
1109: The Others
1110: 
1111: What about you?
1112: 
1113: A Third
1114: 
1115:                    I’m with the others, still.
1116: 
1117: A Fourth
1118: 
1119: Come to the Castle, you’ll find there
1120: The prettiest girls, the finest beer,            815
1121: And the best place for a fight.
1122: A Fifth
1123: 
1124: You quarrelsome fool, are you looking
1125: For a third good hiding?
1126: Not for me, that place, I hate its very sight.
1127: 
1128: A Maidservant
1129: 
1130: No, No! I’m going back to town.                  820
1131: 
1132: Another
1133: 
1134: We’ll find him by those poplar trees for sure.
1135: 
1136: The First
1137: 
1138: Well that’s no joy for me, now:
1139: He’ll walk by your side, of course,
1140: He’ll dance with you on the green.
1141: Where’s the fun in that for me, then!            825
1142: 
1143: 
1144: The Other
1145: 
1146: I’m sure he’s not alone, he said
1147: He’d bring along that Curly-head.
1148: 
1149: A Student
1150: 
1151: My how they strut those bold women!
1152: Brother, come on! We’ll follow them.
1153: Fierce tobacco, strong beer,                     830
1154: And a girl in her finery, I prefer.
1155: A Citizen’s Daughter
1156: 
1157: They are handsome boys there, I see!
1158: But it’s truly a disgrace:
1159: They could have the best of company,
1160: And run after a painted face!                  835
1161: 
1162: Second Student (to the first)
1163: 
1164: Not so fast! Those two behind,
1165: They walk about so sweetly,
1166: One must be that neighbour of mine:
1167: I could fall for her completely.
1168: They pass by with demure paces,                840
1169: But in the end they’ll go with us.
1170: 
1171: The First
1172: 
1173: Brother, no! I shouldn’t bother, anyway.
1174: Quick! Before our quarry gets away.
1175: The hand that wields a broom on Saturday,
1176: Gives the best caress, on Sunday too, I say.   845
1177: 
1178: Citizen
1179: 
1180: No, the new mayor doesn’t suit me!
1181: Now he’s there he’s getting cocky.
1182: And what’s he done to help the town?
1183: Isn’t it getting worse each day?
1184: As always it’s us who must obey,               850
1185: And pay more money down.
1186: 
1187: A Beggar (sings)
1188: 
1189: Fine gentlemen, and lovely ladies,
1190: Rosy-cheeked and finely dressed,
1191: You could help me, for your aid is
1192: Needed: see, ease my distress!                 855
1193: Don’t let me throw my song away,
1194: Only he who gives is happy.
1195: A day when all men celebrate,
1196: Will be a harvest day for me!
1197: 
1198: Another Citizen
1199: 
1200: On holidays there’s nothing I like better     860
1201: Than talking about war and war’s display,
1202: When in Turkey far away,
1203: People one another batter.
1204: You sit by the window: have a glass:
1205: See the bright boats glide down the river,    865
1206: Then you walk back home and bless
1207: Its peacefulness, and peace, forever.
1208: 
1209: Third Citizen
1210: 
1211: Neighbour, yes! I like that too:
1212: Let them go and break their heads,
1213: Make the mess they often do:                  870
1214: So long as we’re safe in our beds.
1215: 
1216: An Old Woman (to the citizen’s daughter)
1217: 
1218: Ah! So pretty! Sweet young blood!
1219: Who wouldn’t gaze at you?
1220: Don’t be so proud! I’m very good!
1221: And what you want, I’ll bring you.            875
1222: 
1223: The Citizen’s Daughter
1224: 
1225: Agatha, come away! I must go carefully:
1226: No walking freely with such a witch as her:
1227: For on Saint Andrew’s Night she really
1228: Showed me who’ll be my future Lover.
1229: The Other
1230: 
1231: She showed me mine in a crystal ball,          880
1232: A soldier, with lots of other brave men:
1233: I look around: among them all,
1234: Yet I can never find him.
1235: 
1236: The Soldiers
1237: 
1238: Castles with towering
1239: Ramparts and wall,                             885
1240: Proud girls showing
1241: Disdain for us all,
1242: We want them to fall!
1243: The action is brave,
1244: And splendid the pay!                          890
1245: So let the trumpet,
1246: Do our recruiting,
1247: Calling to joy
1248: Calling to ruin.
1249: It’s a storm, blowing!                         895
1250: But it’s the life too!
1251: Girls and castles
1252: We must win you.
1253: The action is brave,
1254: Splendid the pay!                              900
1255: And the soldiers
1256: Go marching away.
1257: 
1258: (Faust and Wagner)
1259: 
1260: Faust
1261: 
1262: Rivers and streams are freed from ice
1263: By Spring’s sweet enlivening glance.
1264: Valleys, green with Hope’s happiness, dance:   905
1265: Old Winter, in his weakness, sighs,
1266: Withdrawing to the harsh mountains.
1267: From there, retreating, he sends down
1268: Impotent showers of hail that show
1269: In stripes across the quickening ground.       910
1270: But the sun allows nothing white below,
1271: Change and growth are everywhere,
1272: He enlivens all with his colours there,
1273: And lacking flowers of the fields outspread,
1274: He takes these gaudy people instead.           915
1275: Turn round, and from this mountain height,
1276: Look down, where the town’s in sight.
1277: That cavernous, dark gate,
1278: The colourful crowd penetrate,
1279: All will take the sun today,                   920
1280: The Risen Lord they’ll celebrate,
1281: And feel they are resurrected,
1282: From low houses, dully made,
1283: From work, where they’re constricted,
1284: From the roofs’ and gables’ weight,            925
1285: From the crush of narrow streets,
1286: From the churches’ solemn night
1287: They’re all brought to the light.
1288: Look now: see! The crowds, their feet
1289: Crushing the gardens and meadows,              930
1290: While on the river a cheerful fleet
1291: Of little boats, everywhere it flows.
1292: And over-laden, ready to sink,
1293: The last barge takes to the stream.
1294: From far off on the mountain’s brink,
1295: All the bright clothing gleams.
1296: I hear the noise from the village risen,
1297: Here is the people’s true Heaven,
1298: High and low shout happily:
1299: Here I am Man: here, dare to be!               940
1300: Wagner
1301: 
1302: Doctor, to take a walk with you,
1303: Is an honour and a prize:
1304: Alone I’d have no business here, true,
1305: Since everything that’s coarse I despise.
1306: Shrieking, fiddlers, skittles flying,                 945
1307: To me it’s all a hateful noise:
1308: They rush about possessed, crying,
1309: And call it singing: and call it joy.
1310: 
1311: (Farm-workers under the lime tree. Dance and Song.)
1312: 
1313: The shepherd for the dance, had on
1314: His gaudy jacket, wreath, and ribbon,                 950
1315: Making a fine show,
1316: Under the linden-tree, already,
1317: Everyone was dancing madly.
1318: Hey! Hey!
1319: Hurrah! Hurray!                                       955
1320: So goes the fiddle-bow.
1321: 
1322: In his haste, in a whirl,
1323: He stumbled against a girl,
1324: With his elbow flailing:
1325: Lively, she turned, and said:                         960
1326: Mind out, you wooden-head!
1327: Hey! Hey!
1328: Hurrah! Hurray!
1329: Just watch where you’re sailing!
1330: 
1331: Fast around the circle bright,                        965
1332: They danced to left and right,
1333: Skirts and jackets flying.
1334: They grew red: they grew warm,
1335: They rested, panting, arm on arm
1336: Hey! Hey!                                             970
1337: Hurrah! Hurray!
1338: And hip, and elbow, lying.
1339: Don’t be so familiar then!
1340: That’s how many a lying man,
1341: Cheated his wife so!                         975
1342: But he soon tempted her aside,
1343: And from the linden echoed wide:
1344: Hey! Hey!
1345: Hurrah! Hurray!
1346: So goes the fiddle-bow.                      980
1347: 
1348: An Old Farmer
1349: 
1350: Doctor, it’s good of you today
1351: Not to shun the crowd,
1352: So that among the folk, at play,
1353: The learned man walks about.
1354: Then have some from the finest jug           985
1355: That we’ve filled with fresh ale first,
1356: I offer it now and wish it would,
1357: Not only quench your thirst:
1358: But the count of drops it holds
1359: May it exceed your hours, all told.          990
1360: 
1361: Faust
1362: 
1363: I’ll take some of your foaming drink,
1364: And offer you all, health and thanks.
1365: 
1366: (The people gather round him in a circle.)
1367: 
1368: The Old Farmer
1369: 
1370: Truly, it’s a thing well done:
1371: You’re here on our day of happiness,
1372: Since in evil times now gone,
1373: You’ve eased our distress!
1374: Many a man stands here alive,
1375: Whom your father, at the last,
1376: Snatched from the fever’s rage,
1377: While the plague went past.                  1000
1378: And you, only a young man, went,
1379: Into every house of sickness, then,
1380: Though many a corpse was carried forth,
1381: You walked safely out again.
1382: Many a hard trial you withstood,             1005
1383: A Helper helped by the Helper above.
1384: 
1385: All
1386: 
1387: Health to the man who’s proven true,
1388: Long may he help me and you!
1389: 
1390: Faust
1391: 
1392: To Him above bow down instead,
1393: Who teaches help, and sends his aid.         1010
1394: 
1395: (He walks off, with Wagner.)
1396: 
1397: Wagner
1398: 
1399: How it must feel, O man of genius,
1400: To be respected by the crowd!
1401: O happy he whose gifts endow
1402: Him with such advantages!
1403: The father shows you to his son, now         1015
1404: Each one asks and pushes near,
1405: The fiddle halts, and the dancers there:
1406: You pass: in ranks they stop to see,
1407: And throw their caps high in the air:
1408: A little more and they’d bend the knee,      1020
1409: As if what they worshipped was holy.
1410: 
1411: Faust
1412: 
1413: Climb these few steps to that stone,
1414: Here we’ll rest from our wandering.
1415: Here I’ve sat often, thoughtful and alone,
1416: Tormenting myself with prayer and fasting.   1025
1417: Rich in hope, and firm of faith,
1418: Wringing my hands, with sighs even,
1419: Tears, to force the end of plague
1420: From the very God of Heaven.
1421: The crowd’s approval now’s like scorn.          1030
1422: O if you could read within me
1423: How little the father and the son
1424: Deserve a fraction of their glory.
1425: My father was a gloomy, honourable man,
1426: Who pondered Nature and the heavenly spheres,   1035
1427: Honestly, in his own fashion,
1428: With eccentric studies it appears:
1429: He, in his adepts’ company,
1430: Locked in his dark workshop, forever
1431: Tried with endless recipes,                     1040
1432: To make things opposite flow together.
1433: The fiery Lion, a daring suitor,
1434: Wed the Lily, in a lukewarm bath, there
1435: In a fiery flame, both of them were
1436: Strained from one bride-bed into another,       1045
1437: Until the young Queen was descried,
1438: In a mix of colours, in the glass:
1439: There was the medicine: the patient died.
1440: And who recovered? No one asked.
1441: So we roamed, with our hellish pills,           1050
1442: Among the valleys and the hills,
1443: Worse than the pestilence itself we were.
1444: I’ve poisoned a thousand: that’s quite clear:
1445: And now from the withered old must hear
1446: How men praise a shameless murderer.            1055
1447: 
1448: Wagner
1449: 
1450: How can you grieve at that!
1451: Isn’t it enough for an honest man
1452: To exercise the skill he has,
1453: Carefully, precisely, as given?
1454: Honour your father as a youth,                  1060
1455: And receive his teaching in your soul,
1456: As a man, then, add to scientific truth,
1457: So your son can achieve a higher goal.
1458: Faust
1459: 
1460: O happy the man who still can hope
1461: Though drowned in a sea of error!              1065
1462: Man needs the things he doesn’t know,
1463: What he knows is useless, forever.
1464: But don’t let such despondency
1465: Spoil the deep goodness of the hour!
1466: In the evening glow, we see                    1070
1467: The houses gleaming, green-embowered.
1468: Mild it retreats, the day that’s left,
1469: It slips away to claim new being.
1470: Ah, that no wing from earth can lift
1471: Me, closer and closer to it, striving!         1075
1472: I’d see, in eternal evening’s light,
1473: The silent Earth beneath my feet, forever,
1474: The heights on fire, each valley quiet
1475: While silver streams flow to a golden river.
1476: The wild peaks with their deep clefts,         1080
1477: Would cease to bar my godlike way,
1478: Already the sea with its warm depths,
1479: Opens to my astonished gaze.
1480: At last the weary god sinks down to night:
1481: But in me a newer yearning wakes,              1085
1482: I hasten on, drinking his endless light:
1483: The dark behind me: and ahead the day.
1484: Heaven above me: and the waves below,
1485: A lovely dream, although it vanishes.
1486: Ah! Wings of the mind, so weightless           1090
1487: No bodily wings could ever be so.
1488: Yet it’s natural in every spirit, too,
1489: That feeling drives us, up and on,
1490: When over us, lost in the vault of blue,
1491: The lark sings his piercing song,              1095
1492: When over the steep pine-filled peaks,
1493: The eagle widely soars,
1494: And across the plains and seas,
1495: The cranes seek their home shores.
1496: Wagner
1497: 
1498: I’ve often had strange moments, I know,            1100
1499: But I’ve never felt yearnings quite like those:
1500: The joys of woods and fields soon fade
1501: I wouldn’t ask the birds for wings: indeed,
1502: How differently the mind’s raptures lead
1503: Us on, from book to book, and page to page!        1105
1504: Then winter nights are beautiful, and sweet,
1505: A blissful warmth steals through your limbs, too
1506: When you’ve unrolled some noble text, complete,
1507: Oh, how heaven’s light descends on you!
1508: 
1509: Faust
1510: 
1511: You only feel the one yearning at best,            1110
1512: Oh, never seek to know the other!
1513: Two souls, alas, exist in my breast,
1514: One separated from another:
1515: One, with its crude love of life, just
1516: Clings to the world, tenaciously, grips tight,     1115
1517: The other soars powerfully above the dust,
1518: Into the far ancestral height.
1519: Oh, let the spirits of the air,
1520: Between the heavens and Earth, weaving,
1521: Descend through the golden atmosphere,             1120
1522: And lead me on to new and varied being!
1523: Yes, if a magic cloak were mine, that
1524: Would carry me off to foreign lands,
1525: Not for the costliest garment in my hands,
1526: For the mantle of a king, would I resign it!       1125
1527: 
1528: Wagner
1529: 
1530: Don’t call to that familiar crowd,
1531: Streaming in misty circles, spreading,
1532: Preparing a thousand dangers now,
1533: On every side, for human beings.
1534: The North winds’ sharp teeth penetrate,            1130
1535: Down here, and spit you with their fangs:
1536: Then the East’s drying winds are at the gate,
1537: To feed themselves on your lungs.
1538: If, from the South, the desert sends them,
1539: And fire on fire burns on your brow,                    1135
1540: The West brings a swarm to quench them,
1541: And you and field and meadow drown.
1542: They hear us, while they’re harming us,
1543: Hear us, while they are betraying:
1544: They make out they’re from heaven above,                1140
1545: And lisp like angels when they’re lying.
1546: Let’s go on! The world has darkened,
1547: The air is cool: the mists descend!
1548: Man values his own house at night.
1549: What is it occupies your sight?                         1145
1550: What troubles you so, in the evening?
1551: 
1552: Faust
1553: 
1554: Through corn and stubble, see that black dog running?
1555: 
1556: Wagner
1557: 
1558: I saw him long ago: he seems a wretched thing.
1559: 
1560: Faust
1561: 
1562: Look at him closely! What do you make of him?
1563: 
1564: Wagner
1565: 
1566: A dog that, in the way they do,                         1150
1567: Sniffs around to find his master.
1568: 
1569: Faust
1570: 
1571: See how he winds in wide spirals too,
1572: Round us here, yet always coming nearer?
1573: And if I’m right, I see a swirl of fire
1574: Twisting about, behind his track.                       1155
1575: Wagner
1576: 
1577: Perhaps your eyesight proves a liar,
1578: I only see a dog, that’s black.
1579: 
1580: Faust
1581: 
1582: It seems to me that with a subtle magic,
1583: He winds a fatal knot around our feet.
1584: 
1585: Wagner
1586: 
1587: I see his timid and uncertain antics,            1160
1588: It’s strangers, not his master, whom he meets.
1589: 
1590: Faust
1591: 
1592: The circle narrows: now he’s here!
1593: 
1594: Wagner
1595: 
1596: You see a dog, there’s no spectre near!
1597: He barks uncertainly, lies down and crawls,
1598: Wags his tail. Dogs’ habits, after all.          1165
1599: 
1600: Faust
1601: 
1602: Come on! Here, now! Here, to me!
1603: 
1604: Wagner
1605: 
1606: He’s a dogged hound, I agree.
1607: Stand still and he holds his ground:
1608: Talk to him, he dances round:
1609: What you’ve lost, he’ll bring to you:            1170
1610: Retrieve a stick from the water, too.
1611: 
1612: Faust
1613: You’re right: and I see nothing
1614: Like a Spirit there, it’s only training.
1615: 
1616: Wagner
1617: 
1618: A wise man finds agreeable,
1619: A dog that’s learnt its lesson well.       1175
1620: Yes, he deserves all your favour,
1621: Among the students, the true scholar!
1622: 
1623: (They enter the City gate.)
1624: Part I Scene III: The Study
1625: 
1626: (Faust enters, with the dog.)
1627: 
1628: Faust
1629: 
1630: Fields and meadows now I’ve left
1631: Clothed in deepest night,
1632: Full of presentiments, a holy dread     1180
1633: Wakes the better soul in me to light.
1634: Wild desires no longer stir
1635: At every restless act of mine:
1636: Love for Humanity is here,
1637: And here is Love Divine.                1185
1638: 
1639: Quiet, dog! Stop running to and fro!
1640: Why are you snuffling at the door?
1641: Lie down now, behind the stove,
1642: There’s my best cushion on the floor.
1643: Since you amused us running, leaping,   1190
1644: Out on the mountainside, with zest,
1645: Now I take you into my keeping,
1646: A welcome, and a silent guest.
1647: 
1648: Ah, when in our narrow room,
1649: The friendly lamp glows on the shelf,   1195
1650: Brightness burns in our inner gloom,
1651: In the Heart, that knows itself.
1652: Reason speaks with insistence,
1653: And Hope once more appears,
1654: We see the River of Existence,          1200
1655: Ah, the founts of Life, are near.
1656: Don’t growl, dog! With this holy sound
1657: Which I, with all my soul, embrace,
1658: Your bestial noise seems out of place.
1659: Men usually scorn the things, I’ve found,             1205
1660: That, by them, can’t be understood,
1661: Grumbling at beauty, and the good,
1662: That to them seems wearisome:
1663: Can’t a dog, then, snarl like them?
1664: 
1665: Oh, yet now I can feel no contentment                 1210
1666: Flow through me, despite my best intent.
1667: Why must the stream fail so quickly,
1668: And once again leave us thirsty?
1669: I’ve long experience of it, yet I think
1670: I could supply what’s missing, easily:         1215
1671: We learn to value what’s beyond the earthly,
1672: We yearn to reach revelation’s brink,
1673: That’s nowhere nobler or more excellent
1674: Than where it burns in the New Testament.
1675: I yearn to render the first version,                  1220
1676: With true feeling, once and for all,
1677: Translate the sacred original
1678: Into my beloved German.
1679: (He opens the volume, and begins.)
1680: 
1681: It’s written here: ‘In the Beginning was the Word!’
1682: Here I stick already! Who can help me? It’s absurd,   1225
1683: Impossible, for me to rate the word so highly
1684: I must try to say it differently
1685: If I’m truly inspired by the Spirit. I find
1686: I’ve written here: ‘In the Beginning was the Mind’.
1687: Let me consider that first sentence,                  1230
1688: So my pen won’t run on in advance!
1689: Is it Mind that works and creates what’s ours?
1690: It should say: ‘In the beginning was the Power!’
1691: Yet even while I write the words down,
1692: I’m warned: I’m no closer with these I’ve found.      1235
1693: The Spirit helps me! I have it now, intact.
1694: And firmly write: ‘In the Beginning was the Act!’
1695: 
1696: If I’m to share my room with you,
1697: Dog, you can stop howling too:
1698: Stop your yapping!                                    1240
1699: A fellow who’s always snapping,
1700: I can’t allow too near me.
1701: One of us you see,
1702: Must leave the other free.
1703: I’ve no more hospitality to show,                     1245
1704: The door’s open, you can go.
1705: But what’s this I see!
1706: Can this happen naturally?
1707: Is it a phantom or is it real?
1708: The dog’s growing big and tall.                       1250
1709: He rises powerfully,
1710: It’s no doglike shape I see!
1711: What a spectre I brought home!
1712: Like a hippo in the room,
1713: With fiery eyes, and fearful jaws.                    1255
1714: Oh! Now, what you are, I’m sure!
1715: The Key of Solomon is good
1716: For conjuring your half-hellish brood.
1717: Spirits (In the corridor.)
1718: 
1719: Something’s trapped inside!
1720: Don’t follow it: stay outside!          1260
1721: Like a fox in a snare
1722: An old lynx from hell trembles there.
1723: Be careful what you’re about!
1724: Float here: float there,
1725: Under and over,                         1265
1726: And he’ll work his way out.
1727: If you know how to help him,
1728: Don’t let yourself fail him!
1729: Since it’s all done for sure,
1730: Just for your pleasure.                 1270
1731: 
1732: Faust
1733: 
1734: First speak the Words of the Four
1735: To encounter the creature.
1736: Salamander, be glowing,
1737: Undine, flow near,
1738: Sylph, disappear,                       1275
1739: Gnome, be delving.
1740: 
1741: Who does not know
1742: The Elements so,
1743: Their power sees,
1744: And properties,                         1280
1745: Cannot lord it
1746: Over the Spirits.
1747: 
1748: Vanish in flame,
1749: Salamander!
1750: Rush together in foam,                  1285
1751: Undine!
1752: Shine with meteor-gleam,
1753: Sylph!
1754: Bring help to the home,
1755: Incubus! Incubus!                       1290
1756: Go before and end it thus!
1757: None of the Four
1758: Show in the creature.
1759: He lies there quietly grinning at me:
1760: I’ve not stirred him enough it seems.                                 1295
1761: But you’ll hear how
1762: I’ll press him hard now.
1763: My good fellow, are you
1764: Exiled from Hell’s crew?
1765: Witness the Symbol                                                    1300
1766: Before which they bow,
1767: The dark crowd there!
1768: Now it swells, with its bristling hair.
1769: Depraved being!
1770: Can you know what you’re seeing?                                      1305
1771: The uncreated One
1772: With name unexpressed,
1773: Poured through Heaven,
1774: Pierced without redress?
1775: 
1776: Spellbound, behind the stove,                                         1310
1777: An elephant grows.
1778: It fills the room, completely,
1779: It will vanish like mist, I can see.
1780: Don’t rise to the ceiling!
1781: Lie down at your master’s feet!                                       1315
1782: You see I don’t threaten you lightly.
1783: I’ll sting you with fire that’s holy!
1784: Don’t wait for the bright
1785: Triple glowing Light!
1786: Don’t wait for                                                        1320
1787: My highest art!
1788: 
1789: (As the mist clears, Mephistopheles steps from behind the stove, dressed as a
1790: wandering Scholar.)
1791: 
1792: Mephistopheles
1793: 
1794: Why such alarms? What command would my lord impart?
1795: Faust
1796: 
1797: This was the dog’s core!
1798: A wandering scholar? The fact makes me smile.
1799: 
1800: Mephistopheles
1801: 
1802: I bow to the learned lord!                        1325
1803: You certainly made me sweat, in style.
1804: 
1805: Faust
1806: 
1807: How are you named?
1808: 
1809: Mephistopheles
1810: 
1811:                   A slight question
1812: For one who so disdains the Word,
1813: Is so distant from appearance: one
1814: Whom only the vital depths have stirred.          1330
1815: 
1816: Faust
1817: 
1818: We usually gather from your names
1819: The nature of you gentlemen: it’s plain
1820: What you are, we all too clearly recognise
1821: One who’s called Liar, Ruin, Lord of the Flies.
1822: Well, what are you then?                          1335
1823: 
1824: Mephistopheles
1825: 
1826:                 Part of the Power that would
1827: Always wish Evil, and always works the Good.
1828: 
1829: Faust
1830: 
1831: What meaning to these riddling words applies?
1832: Mephistopheles
1833: 
1834: I am the spirit, ever, that denies!
1835: And rightly so: since everything created,
1836: In turn deserves to be annihilated:                  1340
1837: Better if nothing came to be.
1838: So all that you call Sin, you see,
1839: Destruction, in short, what you’ve meant
1840: By Evil is my true element.
1841: 
1842: Faust
1843: 
1844: You call yourself a part, yet seem complete to me?
1845: 
1846: Mephistopheles
1847: 
1848: I’m speaking the truth to you, and modestly.
1849: Even if Man’s accustomed to take
1850: His small world for the Whole, that’s his mistake:
1851: I’m part of the part, that once was - everything,
1852: Part of the darkness, from which Light, issuing,     1350
1853: Proud Light, emergent, disputed the highest place
1854: With its mother Night, the bounds of Space,
1855: And yet won nothing, however hard it tried,
1856: Still stuck to Bodily Things, and so denied.
1857: It flows from bodies, which it beautifies,           1355
1858: And bodies block its way:
1859: I hope the day’s not far away
1860: When it, along with all these bodies, dies.
1861: 
1862: Faust
1863: 
1864: Now I see the plan you follow!
1865: You can’t destroy it all, and so                     1360
1866: You’re working on a smaller scale.
1867: 
1868: Mephistopheles
1869: 
1870: And frankly it’s a sorry tale.
1871: What’s set against the Nothingness,
1872: The Something, World’s clumsiness,
1873: Despite everything I’ve tried,                 1365
1874: Won’t become a nothing: though I’d
1875: Storms, quakes, and fires on every hand,
1876: It deigned to stay as sea and land!
1877: And those Men and creatures, all the damned,
1878: It’s no use my owning any of that crew:        1370
1879: How many I’ve already done with too!
1880: Yet new fresh blood is always going round.
1881: So it goes on, men make me furious!
1882: With water, earth and air, of course,
1883: A thousand buds unfurl                         1375
1884: In wet and dry, warm and cold!
1885: And if I hadn’t kept back fire of old,
1886: I’d have nothing left at all.
1887: 
1888: Faust
1889: 
1890: So you set the Devil’s fist
1891: That vainly clenches itself,                   1380
1892: Against the eternally active,
1893: Wholesome, creative force!
1894: Strange son of Chaos, start
1895: On something else instead!
1896: 
1897: Mephistopheles
1898: 
1899: Truly I’ll think about it: more                1385
1900: Next time, on that head!
1901: Might I be allowed to go?
1902: 
1903: Faust
1904: 
1905: I see no reason for you to ask it.
1906: Since I’ve learnt to know you now,
1907: When you wish: then make a visit.              1390
1908: There’s the door, here’s the window,
1909: And, of course, there’s the chimney.
1910: Mephistopheles
1911: 
1912: I must confess, I’m prevented though
1913: By a little thing that hinders me,
1914: The Druid’s-foot on your doorsill –                         1395
1915: 
1916: Faust
1917: 
1918: The Pentagram gives you pain?
1919: Then tell me, you Son of Hell,
1920: If that’s the case, how did you gain
1921: Entry? Are spirits like you cheated?
1922: 
1923: Mephistopheles
1924: 
1925: Look carefully! It’s not completed:                         1400
1926: One angle, if you inspect it closely
1927: Has, as you see, been left a little open.
1928: 
1929: Faust
1930: 
1931: Just by chance as it happens!
1932: And left you prisoner to me?
1933: Success created by approximation!                           1405
1934: 
1935: Mephistopheles
1936: 
1937: The dog saw nothing, in his animation,
1938: Now the affair seems inside out,
1939: The Devil can’t get out of the house.
1940: 
1941: Faust
1942: 
1943: Why not try the window then?
1944: 
1945: Mephistopheles
1946: 
1947: To devils and ghosts the same laws appertain:               1410
1948: The same way they enter in, they must go out.
1949: In the first we’re free, in the second slaves to the act.
1950: Faust
1951: 
1952: So you still have laws in Hell, in fact?
1953: That’s good, since it allows a pact,
1954: And one with you gentlemen truly binds?       1415
1955: 
1956: Mephistopheles
1957: 
1958: What’s promised you’ll enjoy, and find,
1959: There’s nothing mean that we enact.
1960: But it can’t be done so fast,
1961: First we’ll have to talk it through,
1962: Yet, urgently, I beg of you                   1420
1963: Let me go my way at last.
1964: 
1965: Faust
1966: 
1967: Wait a moment now,
1968: Tell me some good news first.
1969: 
1970: Mephistopheles
1971: 
1972: I’ll soon be back, just let me go:
1973: Then you can ask me what you wish.            1425
1974: 
1975: Faust
1976: 
1977: I didn’t place you here, tonight.
1978: You trapped yourself in the lime.
1979: Who snares the devil, holds him tight!
1980: He won’t be caught like that a second time.
1981: 
1982: Mephistopheles
1983: 
1984: I’m willing, if you so wish,                  1430
1985: To stay here, in your company:
1986: So long as we pass the time, and I insist,
1987: On arts of mine, exclusively.
1988: Faust
1989: 
1990: Gladly, you’re free to present
1991: Them, as long as they’re all pleasant.   1435
1992: 
1993: Mephistopheles
1994: 
1995: My friend you’ll win more
1996: For your senses, in an hour,
1997: Than in a whole year’s monotony.
1998: What the tender spirits sing,
1999: The lovely pictures that they bring,     1440
2000: Are no empty wizardry.
2001: First your sense of smell’s invited,
2002: Then your palate is delighted,
2003: And then your touch, you see.
2004: Now, I need no preparation,              1445
2005: We’re all here, so let’s begin!
2006: 
2007: Spirits
2008: 
2009: Vanish, you shadowy
2010: Vaults above!
2011: Cheerfully show,
2012: The friendliest blue                     1450
2013: Of aether, down here.
2014: Would that shadowy
2015: Clouds had gone!
2016: Starlight sparkling
2017: Milder sun                               1455
2018: Shining clear.
2019: Heavenly children
2020: In lovely confusion,
2021: Swaying and bending,
2022: Drifting past.                           1460
2023: Affectionate yearning,
2024: Following fast:
2025: Their garments flowing
2026: With fluttering ribbons,
2027: Cover the gardens,                       1465
2028: Cover the leaves,
2029: Where with each other
2030: In deep conversation
2031: Lover meets lover.
2032: Leaves on leaves!         1470
2033: Tendrils’ elation!
2034: Grapes beneath
2035: Crushed in a stream,
2036: Pressed to extreme,
2037: Crushed to fountain,      1475
2038: Of foaming wine,
2039: Trickling, fine,
2040: Through rocks divine,
2041: Leaving the heights,
2042: Spreading beneath,        1480
2043: Broad as the seas,
2044: Valleys it fills
2045: Round the green hills.
2046: And the wings still,
2047: Blissfully drunk,         1485
2048: Fly to the sun,
2049: Fly to the brightness,
2050: Towards the islands,
2051: Out of the waves
2052: Magically raised:         1490
2053: Now we can hear
2054: The choir of joy near,
2055: Over the meadow,
2056: See how they dance now,
2057: All in the air            1495
2058: Dispersing there.
2059: Some of them climbing
2060: Over the mountains,
2061: Others are swimming
2062: Over the ocean,           1500
2063: Others take flight:
2064: All towards Life,
2065: All towards distant,
2066: Love of the stars, and
2067: Approval’s bliss.         1505
2068: Mephistopheles
2069: 
2070: He’s asleep! Enough, you delicate children of air!
2071: You’ve sung to him faithfully, I declare!
2072: I’m in your debt for all this.
2073: He’s not yet the man to hold devils fast!
2074: Spellbind him with dream-forms, cast                 1510
2075: Him deep into illusions’ sea:
2076: Now, for the magic sill I must pass,
2077: I could use rat’s teeth: no need for me
2078: To conjure up a lengthier spell,
2079: One’s rustling here that will do well.               1515
2080: 
2081: The Lord of Rats and Mice,
2082: Of Flies, Frogs, Bugs and Lice,
2083: Summons you to venture here,
2084: And gnaw the threshold where
2085: He stains it with a little oil -                     1520
2086: You’ve hopped, already, to your toil!
2087: Now set to work! The fatal point,
2088: Is at the edge, it’s on the front.
2089: One more bite, then it’s complete –
2090: Now Faust, dream deeply, till we meet.               1525
2091: 
2092: Faust (Waking.)
2093: 
2094: Am I cheated then, once again?
2095: Does the Spirit-Realm’s deep yearning fade:
2096: So a mere dream has conjured up the devil,
2097: And only a dog, it was, that ran away?
2098: Part I Scene IV: The Study
2099: 
2100: (Faust, Mephistopheles)
2101: 
2102: Faust
2103: 
2104: A knock? Enter! Who’s plaguing me again?              1530
2105: 
2106: Mephistopheles
2107: 
2108: I am
2109: 
2110: Faust
2111: 
2112:         Enter!
2113: 
2114: Mephistopheles
2115: 
2116:                  Three times you must say it, then.
2117: 
2118: Faust
2119: 
2120: So! Enter!
2121: 
2122: Mephistopheles
2123: 
2124:         Ah, now, you please me.
2125: I hope we’ll get along together:
2126: To drive away the gloomy weather,
2127: I’m dressed like young nobility,                      1535
2128: In a scarlet gold-trimmed coat,
2129: In a little silk-lined cloak,
2130: A cockerel feather in my hat,
2131: With a long, pointed sword,
2132: And I advise you, at that,                            1540
2133: To do as I do, in a word:
2134: So that, footloose, fancy free,
2135: You can experience Life, with me.
2136: Faust
2137: 
2138: This life of earth, its narrowness,
2139: Pains me, however I’m turned out,                            1545
2140: I’m too old to play about,
2141: Too young, still, to be passionless.
2142: What can the world bring me again?
2143: Abstain! You shall! You must! Abstain!
2144: That’s the eternal song                                      1550
2145: That in our ears, forever, rings
2146: The one, that, our whole life long,
2147: Every hour, hoarsely, sings.
2148: I wake in terror with the dawn,
2149: I cry, the bitterest tears, to see                           1555
2150: Day grant no wish of mine, not one
2151: As it passes by on its journey.
2152: Even presentiments of joy
2153: Ebb, in wilful depreciation:
2154: A thousand grimaces life employs                             1560
2155: To hinder me in creation.
2156: Then when night descends I must
2157: Stretch out, worried, on my bed:
2158: What comes to me is never rest,
2159: But some wild dream instead.                                 1565
2160: The God that lives inside my heart,
2161: Can rouse my innermost seeing:
2162: The one enthroned beyond my art,
2163: Can’t stir external being:
2164: And so existence is a burden: sated,                         1570
2165: Death’s desired, and Life is hated.
2166: 
2167: Mephistopheles
2168: 
2169: Yet Death’s a guest who’s visit’s never wholly celebrated.
2170: 
2171: Faust
2172: 
2173: Happy the man whom victory enhances,
2174: Whose brow the bloodstained laurel warms,
2175: Who, after the swift whirling dances,                        1575
2176: Finds himself in some girl’s arms!
2177: If only, in my joy, then, I’d sunk down
2178: Before that enrapturing Spirit power!
2179: 
2180: Mephistopheles
2181: 
2182: Yet someone, from a certain brown
2183: Liquid, drank not a drop, at midnight hour.   1580
2184: 
2185: Faust
2186: 
2187: It seems that you delight in spying.
2188: 
2189: Mephistopheles
2190: 
2191: I know a lot: and yet I’m not all-knowing.
2192: 
2193: Faust
2194: 
2195: When sweet familiar tones drew me,
2196: Away from the tormenting crowd,
2197: Then my other childhood feelings              1585
2198: Better times echoed, and allowed.
2199: So I curse whatever snares the soul,
2200: In its magical, enticing arms,
2201: Banishes it to this mournful hole,
2202: With dazzling, seductive charms!              1590
2203: Cursed be those high Opinions first,
2204: With which the mind entraps itself!
2205: Then glittering Appearance curse,
2206: In which the senses lose themselves!
2207: Curse what deceives us in our dreaming,       1595
2208: With thoughts of everlasting fame!
2209: Curse the flattery of ‘possessing’
2210: Wife and child, lands and name!
2211: Curse Mammon, when he drives us
2212: To bold acts to win our treasure:             1600
2213: Or straightens out our pillows
2214: For us to idle at our leisure!
2215: Curse the sweet juice of the grape!
2216: Curse the highest favours Love lets fall!
2217: Cursed be Hope! Cursed be Faith,                      1605
2218: And cursed be Patience most of all!
2219: 
2220: Choir of Spirits (Unseen)
2221: 
2222: Sorrow! Sorrow!
2223: You’ve destroyed it,
2224: The beautiful world,
2225: With a powerful fist:                                 1610
2226: It tumbles, it’s hurled
2227: To ruin! A demigod crushed it!
2228: We carry
2229: Fragments into the void,
2230: And sadly                                             1615
2231: Lament the Beauty that’s gone.
2232: Stronger
2233: For all of Earth’s sons,
2234: Brighter,
2235: Build it again,                                       1620
2236: Build, in your heart!
2237: Life’s new start,
2238: Begin again,
2239: With senses washed clean,
2240: And sound, then,                                      1625
2241: A newer art!
2242: 
2243: Mephistopheles
2244: 
2245: They’re little, but fine,
2246: These attendants of mine.
2247: Precocious advice they give, listen,
2248: Regarding both action, and passion!                   1630
2249: Into the World outside,
2250: From Solitude, that’s dried
2251: Your sap and senses,
2252: They tempt us.
2253: Stop playing with grief,                              1635
2254: That feeds, a vulture, on your breast,
2255: The worst society, you’ll find, will prompt belief,
2256: That you’re a Man among the rest.
2257: Not that I mean
2258: To shove you into the mass.                  1640
2259: Among ‘the greats’, I’m second-class:
2260: But if you, in my company,
2261: Your path through life would wend,
2262: I’ll willingly condescend
2263: To serve you, as we go.                      1645
2264: I’m your man, and so,
2265: If it suits you of course,
2266: I’m your slave: I’m yours!
2267: 
2268: Faust
2269: 
2270: And what must I do in exchange?
2271: 
2272: Mephistopheles
2273: 
2274: There’s lots of time: you’ve got the gist.   1650
2275: 
2276: Faust
2277: 
2278: No, no! The Devil is an egotist,
2279: Does nothing lightly, or in God’s name,
2280: To help another, so I insist,
2281: Speak your demands out loud,
2282: Such servants are risks, in a house.         1655
2283: 
2284: Mephistopheles
2285: 
2286: I’ll be your servant here, and I’ll
2287: Not stop or rest, at your decree:
2288: When we’re together, on the other side,
2289: You’ll do the same for me.
2290: Faust
2291: 
2292: The ‘other side’ concerns me less:                    1660
2293: Shatter this world, in pieces,
2294: The other one can take its place,
2295: The root of my joy’s on this Earth,
2296: And this Sun lights my sorrow:
2297: If I must part from them tomorrow,                    1665
2298: What can or will be, that I’ll face.
2299: I’ll hear no more of it, of whether
2300: In that future, men both hate and love,
2301: Or whether in those spheres, forever,
2302: We’re given a below and an above.                     1670
2303: 
2304: Mephistopheles
2305: 
2306: In that case, you can venture all.
2307: Commit yourself: today, you shall
2308: View my arts with joy: I mean
2309: To show you what no man has seen.
2310: 
2311: Faust
2312: 
2313: Poor devil what can you give? When has ever           1675
2314: A human spirit, in its highest endeavour,
2315: Been understood by such a one as you?
2316: You have a never-satiating food,
2317: You have your restless gold, a slew
2318: Of quicksilver, melting in the hand,                  1680
2319: Games whose prize no man can land,
2320: A girl, who while she’s on my arm,
2321: Snares a neighbour, with her eyes:
2322: And Honour’s fine and godlike charm,
2323: That, like a meteor, dies?                            1685
2324: Show me fruits then that rot, before they’re ready.
2325: And trees grown green again, each day, too!
2326: Mephistopheles
2327: 
2328: Such commands don’t frighten me:
2329: With such treasures I can truly serve you.
2330: Still, my good friend, a time may come,         1690
2331: When one prefers to eat what’s good in peace.
2332: 
2333: Faust
2334: 
2335: When I lie quiet in bed, at ease.
2336: Then let my time be done!
2337: If you fool me, with flatteries,
2338: Till my own self’s a joy to me,                 1695
2339: If you snare me with luxury –
2340: Let that be the last day I see!
2341: That bet I’ll make!
2342: 
2343: Mephistopheles
2344:                     Done!
2345: 
2346: Faust
2347:                      And quickly!
2348: When, to the Moment then, I say:
2349: ‘Ah, stay a while! You are so lovely!’          1700
2350: Then you can grasp me: then you may,
2351: Then, to my ruin, I’ll go gladly!
2352: Then they can ring the passing bell,
2353: Then from your service you are free,
2354: The clocks may halt, the hands be still,        1705
2355: And time be past and done, for me!
2356: 
2357: Mephistopheles
2358: 
2359: Consider well, we’ll not forget.
2360: Faust
2361: 
2362: You have your rights, complete:
2363: I never over-estimate my powers.
2364: I’ll be a slave, in defeat:                       1710
2365: Why ask whose slave or yours?
2366: 
2367: Mephistopheles
2368: 
2369: Today, likewise, at the Doctors’ Feast
2370: I’ll do my duty as your servant.
2371: One thing, though! – Re: life and death, I want
2372: A few lines from you, at the least.               1715
2373: 
2374: 
2375: Faust
2376: 
2377: You pedant, you demand it now in writing?
2378: You still won’t take Man’s word for anything?
2379: It’s not enough that the things I say,
2380: Will always accord with my future?
2381: The world never ceases to wear away,              1720
2382: And shall a promise bind me, then, forever?
2383: Yet that’s the illusion in our minds,
2384: And who then would be free of it?
2385: Happy the man, who pure truth finds,
2386: And who’ll never deign to sacrifice it!           1725
2387: Still a document, written and signed,
2388: That’s a ghost makes all men fear it.
2389: The word is already dying in the pen,
2390: And wax and leather hold the power then.
2391: What do you want from me base spirit?             1730
2392: Will iron: marble: parchment: paper do it?
2393: Shall I write with stylus, pen or chisel?
2394: I’ll leave the whole decision up to you.
2395: Mephistopheles
2396: 
2397: Why launch into oratory too?
2398: Hot-tempered: you exaggerate as well.       1735
2399: Any bit of paper’s just as good.
2400: And you can sign it with a drop of blood.
2401: 
2402: Faust
2403: 
2404: If it will satisfy you, and it should,
2405: Then let’s complete the farce in full.
2406: 
2407: Mephistopheles
2408: 
2409: Blood is a quite special fluid.             1740
2410: 
2411: Faust
2412: 
2413: Have no fear I’ll break this pact!
2414: The extreme I can promise you: it is
2415: All the power my efforts can extract.
2416: I’ve puffed myself up so highly
2417: I belong in your ranks now.                 1745
2418: The mighty Spirit scorns me
2419: And Nature shuts me out.
2420: The thread of thought has turned to dust,
2421: Knowledge fills me with disgust.
2422: Let the depths of sensuality                1750
2423: Satisfy my burning passion!
2424: And, its impenetrable mask on,
2425: Let every marvel be prepared for me!
2426: Let’s plunge into time’s torrent,
2427: Into the whirlpools of event!               1755
2428: Then let joy, and distress,
2429: Frustration, and success,
2430: Follow each other, as well they can:
2431: Restless activity proves the man!
2432: Mephistopheles
2433: 
2434: No goal or measure’s set for you.            1760
2435: Do as you wish, nibble at everything,
2436: Catch at fragments while you’re flying,
2437: Enjoy it all, whatever you find to do.
2438: Now grab at it, and don’t be stupid!
2439: 
2440: Faust
2441: 
2442: It’s not joy we’re about: you heard it.      1765
2443: I’ll take the frenzy, pain-filled elation,
2444: Loving hatred, enlivening frustration.
2445: Cured of its urge to know, my mind
2446: In future, will not hide from any pain,
2447: And what is shared by all mankind,           1770
2448: In my innermost self, I’ll contain:
2449: My soul will grasp the high and low,
2450: My heart accumulate its bliss and woe,
2451: So this self will embrace all theirs,
2452: That, in the end, their fate it shares.      1775
2453: 
2454: Mephistopheles
2455: 
2456: Believe me, many a thousand year
2457: They’ve chewed hard food, and yet
2458: From the cradle to the bier,
2459: Not one has ever digested it!
2460: Trust one of us, this Whole thing            1780
2461: Was only made for a god’s delight!
2462: In eternal splendour he is dwelling,
2463: He placed us in the darkness quite,
2464: And only gave you day and night.
2465: 
2466: Faust
2467: 
2468: But, I will!                                 1785
2469: Mephistopheles
2470: 
2471:               That’s good to hear!
2472: Yet I’ve a fear, just the one:
2473: Time is short, and art is long.
2474: I think you need instruction.
2475: Join forces with a poet: use poetry,
2476: Let him roam in imagination,                  1790
2477: You’ll gain every noble quality
2478: From your honorary occupation,
2479: The lion’s brave attitude
2480: The wild stag’s swiftness,
2481: The Italian’s fiery blood,                    1795
2482: The North’s persistence.
2483: Let him find the mysterious
2484: Meeting of generous and devious,
2485: While you, with passions young and hot,
2486: Fall in love, according to the plot.          1800
2487: I’d like to see such a gentleman, among us,
2488: And I’d call him Mister Microcosmus.
2489: 
2490: Faust
2491: 
2492: What am I then, if it’s a flight too far,
2493: For me to gain that human crown
2494: I yearn towards with every sense I own?       1805
2495: 
2496: Mephistopheles
2497: 
2498: In the end, you are – what you are.
2499: Set your hair in a thousand curlicues
2500: Place your feet in yard-high shoes,
2501: You’ll remain forever, what you are.
2502: 
2503: Faust
2504: 
2505: All the treasures of the human spirit         1810
2506: I feel that I’ve expended, uselessly.
2507: And wherever, at the last, I sit,
2508: No new power flows, in me.
2509: I’m not a hair’s breadth taller, as you see,
2510: And I’m no nearer to Infinity.                  1815
2511: 
2512: Mephistopheles
2513: 
2514: My dear sir, you see the thing
2515: Exactly as all men see it: why,
2516: We must re-order everything,
2517: Before the joys of life slip by.
2518: Hang it! Hands and feet, belong to you,         1820
2519: Certainly, a head, and a backside,
2520: Yet everything I use as new
2521: Why is my ownership of it denied?
2522: When I can count on six stallions,
2523: Isn’t their horsepower mine to use?             1825
2524: I drive behind, and am a proper man,
2525: As though I’d twenty-four legs, too.
2526: Look lively! Leave the senses be,
2527: And plunge into the world with me!
2528: I say to you that scholarly fellows             1830
2529: Are like the cattle on an arid heath:
2530: Some evil spirit leads them round in circles,
2531: While sweet green meadows lie beneath.
2532: 
2533: Faust
2534: 
2535: How shall we begin then?
2536: 
2537: Mephistopheles
2538: 
2539:              From here, we’ll first win free.
2540: What kind of a martyrs’ hole can this be?       1835
2541: What kind of a teacher of life is he,
2542: Who fills young minds with ennui?
2543: Let your neighbours do it, and go!
2544: Do you want to thresh straw forever?
2545: The best things you can ever know,              1840
2546: You dare not tell the youngsters, ever.
2547: I hear one of them arriving, too!
2548: Faust
2549: 
2550: I’ve no desire to see him, though.
2551: 
2552: Mephistopheles
2553: 
2554: The poor lad’s waited hours for you.
2555: He mustn’t go away un-consoled.                 1845
2556: Come: give me your cap and gown.
2557: The mask should look delicious. So!
2558: 
2559: (He disguises himself.)
2560: 
2561: Now I’ve lost what wit’s my own!
2562: I want fifteen minutes with him, only:
2563: Meanwhile get ready for our journey!            1850
2564: 
2565: (Faust exits.)
2566: 
2567: Mephistopheles (In Faust’s long gown.)
2568: 
2569: Reason and Science you despise,
2570: Man’s highest powers: now the lies
2571: Of the deceiving spirit must bind you
2572: With those magic arts that blind you,
2573: And I’ll have you, totally –                    1855
2574: Fate gave him such a spirit
2575: It urges him ever onwards, wildly,
2576: And, in his hasty striving, he has leapt
2577: Beyond all earth’s ecstasies.
2578: I’ll drag him through raw life,                 1860
2579: Through the meaningless and shallow,
2580: I’ll freeze him: stick to him: keep him ripe,
2581: Frustrate his insatiable greed, allow
2582: Food and drink to drift before his eyes:
2583: In vain he’ll beg for consummation,             1865
2584: And if he weren’t the devil’s, why
2585: He’d still go to his ruination!
2586: 
2587: (A student enters.)
2588: Student
2589: 
2590: I’m only here momentarily,
2591: I’ve come, filled with humility,
2592: To speak to, and to stand before ,                  1870
2593: One who’s spoken of with awe.
2594: 
2595: Mephistopheles
2596: 
2597: Your courtesy delights me greatly!
2598: A man like other men you see.
2599: Have you studied then, elsewhere?
2600: 
2601: Student
2602: 
2603: I beg you, please enrol me, here!                   1875
2604: I come to you strong of courage,
2605: Lined in pocket, healthy for my age:
2606: My mother didn’t want to lose me: though,
2607: I’d like to learn what it’s right for me to know.
2608: 
2609: Mephistopheles
2610: 
2611: Then you’ve come to the right place, exactly.       1880
2612: 
2613: Student
2614: 
2615: To be honest, I’d like to go already:
2616: There’s little pleasure for me at all,
2617: In these walls, and all these halls.
2618: It’s such a narrow space I find,
2619: You see no trees, no leaves of any kind,            1885
2620: And in the lectures, on the benches,
2621: All thought deserts me, and my senses.
2622: Mephistopheles
2623: 
2624: It will only come to you with habit.
2625: So the child takes its mother’s breast
2626: Quite unwillingly at first, and yet it    1890
2627: Soon sucks away at her with zest.
2628: So will you at Wisdom’s breast, here,
2629: Feel every day a little zestier.
2630: 
2631: Student
2632: 
2633: I’ll cling to her neck with pleasure:
2634: But only tell me how to find her.         1895
2635: 
2636: Mephistopheles
2637: 
2638: Explain, before you travel on
2639: What faculty you’ve settled on.
2640: 
2641: Student
2642: 
2643: I want to be a true scholar,
2644: I want to grasp, by the collar,
2645: What’s on earth, in heaven above,         1900
2646: In Science, and in Nature too.
2647: 
2648: Mephistopheles
2649: 
2650: Then here’s the very path for you,
2651: But don’t allow yourself to wander off.
2652: 
2653: Student
2654: 
2655: I’ll be present heart and soul:
2656: Of course I’ll want to play,              1905
2657: Have some fun and freedom, though,
2658: On each sweet summer holiday.
2659: Mephistopheles
2660: 
2661: Use your time well: it slips away so fast, yet
2662: Discipline will teach you how to win it.
2663: My dear friend, I’d advise, in sum,              1910
2664: First, the Collegium Logicum.
2665: There your mind will be trained,
2666: As if in Spanish boots, constrained,
2667: So that painfully, as it ought,
2668: It creeps along the way of thought,              1915
2669: Not flitting about all over,
2670: Wandering here and there.
2671: So you’ll learn, in many days,
2672: What you used to do, untaught, as in a haze,
2673: Like eating now, and drinking, you’ll see        1920
2674: The necessity of One! Two! Three!
2675: Truly the intricacy of logic
2676: Is like a master-weaver’s fabric,
2677: Where the loom holds a thousand threads,
2678: Here and there the shuttles go                   1925
2679: And the threads, invisibly, flow,
2680: One pass serves for a thousand instead.
2681: Then the philosopher steps in: he’ll show
2682: That it certainly had to be so:
2683: The first was - so, the second - so,             1930
2684: And so, the third and fourth were - so:
2685: If first and second had never been,
2686: Third and fourth would not be seen.
2687: All praise the scholars, beyond believing,
2688: But few of them ever turn to weaving.            1935
2689: To know and note the living, you’ll find it
2690: Best to first dispense with the spirit:
2691: Then with the pieces in your hand,
2692: Ah! You’ve only lost the spiritual bond.
2693:  ‘Natural treatment’, Chemistry calls it         1940
2694: Mocks at herself, and doesn’t know it.
2695: Student
2696: 
2697: I’m not sure that I quite understand.
2698: 
2699: Mephistopheles
2700: 
2701: You’ll soon know it all, as planned,
2702: When you’ve learnt the science of reduction,
2703: And everything’s proper classification.        1945
2704: 
2705: Student
2706: 
2707: After all that, I feel as stupid
2708: As if I’d a mill wheel in my head.
2709: 
2710: Mephistopheles
2711: 
2712: Next, before all else, you’ll fix
2713: Your mind on Metaphysics!
2714: See that you’re profoundly trained             1950
2715: In what never stirs in a human brain:
2716: You’ll learn a splendid word
2717: For what’s occurred or not occurred.
2718: But for the present take six months
2719: To get yourself in order: start at once.       1955
2720: Five hours every day, lock
2721: Yourself in, with a ticking clock!
2722: Make sure you’re well prepared,
2723: Study each paragraph with care,
2724: So afterwards you’ll be certain                1960
2725: Only what’s in the book, was written:
2726: Then be as diligent when you pen it,
2727: As if the Holy Ghost had said it!
2728: Student
2729: 
2730: You won’t need to tell me twice!
2731: I think, myself, it’s very helpful, too     1965
2732: That one can take back home, and use,
2733: What someone’s penned in black and white.
2734: 
2735: Mephistopheles
2736: 
2737: But choose a faculty, any one!
2738: 
2739: Student
2740: 
2741: I wouldn’t be comfortable with Law.
2742: 
2743: Mephistopheles
2744: 
2745: I couldn’t name you anything more           1970
2746: Vile, I know how dogmatic it’s become.
2747: Laws and rights are handed down
2748: It’s an eternal disgrace:
2749: They’re moved round from town to town
2750: Dragged around from place to place.         1975
2751: Reason is nonsense, kindness a disease,
2752: If you’re a grandchild it’s a curse!
2753: The rights we are born with,
2754: To those, alas, no one refers!
2755: 
2756: Student
2757: 
2758: That just strengthens my disgust.           1980
2759: Happy the student that you instruct!
2760: I’ve nearly settled on Theology.
2761: Mephistopheles
2762: 
2763: I wouldn’t wish to guide you erroneously.
2764: In what that branch of knowledge concerns
2765: It’s so difficult to avoid a fallacious route,       1985
2766: There’s so much poison hidden in what you learn,
2767: And it’s barely distinguishable from the antidote.
2768: The best thing here’s to make a single choice,
2769: Then simply swear by your master’s voice.
2770: On the whole, to words stick fast!                   1990
2771: Through the safest gate you’ll pass
2772: To the Temple of Certainty.
2773: 
2774: Student
2775: 
2776: Yet surely words must have a sense.
2777: 
2778: Mephistopheles
2779: 
2780: Why, yes! But don’t torment yourself with worry,
2781: Where sense fails it’s only necessary                1995
2782: To supply a word, and change the tense.
2783: With words fine arguments can be weighted,
2784: With words whole Systems can be created,
2785: With words, the mind does its conceiving,
2786: No word suffers a jot from thieving.                 2000
2787: 
2788: Student
2789: 
2790: Forgive me, I delay you with my questions,
2791: But I must trouble you again,
2792: On the subject of Medicine,
2793: Have you no helpful word to say?
2794: Three years, so little time applied,                 2005
2795: And, God, the field is rather wide!
2796: If only you had some kind of pointer,
2797: You would feel so much further on.
2798: Mephistopheles (Aside.)
2799: 
2800: I’m tired of this desiccated banter
2801: I really must play the devil, at once.               2010
2802: 
2803: (Aloud.)
2804: 
2805: To grasp the spirit of Medicine’s easily done:
2806: You study the great and little world, until,
2807: In the end you let it carry on
2808: Just as God wills.
2809: Useless to roam round, scientifically:               2015
2810: Everyone learns only what he can:
2811: The one who grasps the Moment fully,
2812: He’s the proper man.
2813: You’re quite a well-made fellow,
2814: You’re not short of courage too,                     2020
2815: And when you’re easy with yourself,
2816: Others will be easy with you.
2817: Study, especially, female behaviour:
2818: Their eternal aches and woes,
2819: All of the thousand-fold,                            2025
2820: Rise from one point, and have one cure.
2821: And if you’re half honourable about it
2822: You shall have them in your pocket.
2823: A title first: to give them comfort you
2824: Have skills that far exceed the others,              2030
2825: Then you’re free to touch the goods, and view
2826: What someone else has prowled around for years.
2827: Take the pulse firmly, you understand,
2828: And then, with sidelong fiery glance,
2829: Grasp the slender hips, in haste,                    2035
2830: To find out whether she’s tight-laced.
2831: 
2832: Student
2833: 
2834: That sounds much better! The Where and How, I see.
2835: Mephistopheles
2836: 
2837: Grey, dear friend, is all theory,
2838: And green the golden tree of life.
2839: 
2840: Student
2841: 
2842: I swear it’s like a dream to me: may I                             2040
2843: Trouble you, at some further time,
2844: To expound your wisdom, so sublime?
2845: 
2846: Mephistopheles
2847: 
2848: As much as I can, I’ll gladly explain.
2849: 
2850: Student
2851: 
2852: I can’t tear myself away,
2853: I must just pass you my album, sir,                                2045
2854: Grant me the favour of your signature!
2855: 
2856: Mephistopheles
2857: 
2858: Very well.
2859: 
2860: (He writes and gives the book back.)
2861: 
2862: Student (Reading Mephistopheles’ Latin inscription which means: ‘You’ll
2863: be like God, acquainted with good and evil’.)
2864: 
2865: Eritis sicut Deus, scientes bonum et malum.
2866: 
2867: (He makes his bows, and takes his leave.)
2868: 
2869: Mephistopheles
2870: 
2871: Just follow the ancient text, and my mother the snake, too:
2872: And then your likeness to God will surely frighten you!            2050
2873: (Faust enters.)
2874: 
2875: Faust
2876: 
2877: Where will we go, then?
2878: 
2879: Mephistopheles
2880: 
2881:                             Where you please.
2882: The little world, and then the great, we’ll see.
2883: With what profit and delight,
2884: This term, you’ll be a parasite!
2885: 
2886: Faust
2887: 
2888: Yet with my long beard, I’ll                               2055
2889: Lack life’s superficial style.
2890: My attempt will come to nothing:
2891: I know, in this world, I don’t fit in.
2892: I feel so small next to other men,
2893: It only means embarrassment.                               2060
2894: 
2895: Mephistopheles
2896: 
2897: My friend, just give yourself completely to it:
2898: When you find yourself, you’ll soon know how to live it.
2899: 
2900: Faust
2901: 
2902: How shall we depart from here, then?
2903: I see not one servant, coach, or horse.
2904: 
2905: Mephistopheles
2906: 
2907: We’ll just spread this cloak wide open,                    2065
2908: Then through the air we’ll take our course.
2909: For a daring trip like this we’re on,
2910: Better not take much baggage along.
2911: A little hot air I’ll ready, first,
2912: To lift us nimbly above the Earth,         2070
2913: And as we’re light we’ll soon get clear:
2914: Congratulations on your new career!
2915: Part I Scene V: Auerbach’s Cellar in Leipzig
2916: 
2917: (Friends happily drinking.)
2918: 
2919: Frosch
2920: 
2921: Will none of you laugh? Nobody drink?
2922: I’ll have to teach you to smile, I think!
2923: You’re all of you like wet straw today,                 2075
2924: And usually you’re well away.
2925: 
2926: Brander
2927: 
2928: That’s up to you, you bring us nothing.
2929: Nothing dumb, or dirty, nothing.
2930: 
2931: Frosch (Pouring a glass of wine over Brander’s head.)
2932: 
2933: You can have both!
2934: 
2935: Brander
2936:                           Rotten swine!
2937: 
2938: Frosch
2939: 
2940: You wanted them both, so you got mine!                  2080
2941: 
2942: Siebel
2943: 
2944: Out the door, whoever fights! Get out!
2945: Let’s sing a heart-felt chorus, drink and shout!
2946: Up! Hurray! Ha!
2947: 
2948: Altmayer
2949: 
2950:                          Ah! I’m in agony!
2951: Earplugs, here! This fellow’s deafened me.
2952: Siebel
2953: 
2954: It’s only when it echoes in the tower,       2085
2955: You hear a bass voice’s real power.
2956: 
2957: Frosch
2958: 
2959: Right, out with him who takes offence!
2960: Ah! Do, re, me!
2961: 
2962: Altmayer
2963: 
2964:                    Ah! Do, re, me!
2965: 
2966: Fosch
2967: 
2968: Our throats are tuned: commence.
2969: 
2970: (He sings.)
2971: 
2972: ‘Dear Holy Roman Empire,                     2090
2973: How do you hold together?’
2974: 
2975: Brander
2976: 
2977: A lousy song! Bah! A political song -
2978: A tiresome song! Thank God, every morning,
2979: It isn’t you who must sit there worrying
2980: About the Empire! At least I’m better for    2095
2981: Not being a King or a Chancellor.
2982: But we should have a leader, so
2983: We’ll choose a Pope of our own.
2984: You know the qualities that can
2985: Swing the vote, and elevate the man.         2100
2986: 
2987: Frosch (Sings.)
2988: 
2989: ‘Sing away, sweet Nightingale,
2990: Greet my girl, and never fail.’
2991: Siebel
2992: 
2993: Don’t greet my girl! I’ll not allow it!
2994: 
2995: Frosch
2996: 
2997: Greet and kiss her! You’ll not stop it!
2998: 
2999: (He sings.)
3000: 
3001: ‘Slip the bolt in deepest night!                  2105
3002: Slip it! Wake, the lover bright.
3003: Slip it to! At break of dawn.’
3004: 
3005: Siebel
3006: 
3007: Yes, sing in praise of her, and boast: sing on!
3008: I’ll laugh later when it suits:
3009: She leads me a dance, she’ll lead you too.        2110
3010: She should have a dwarf for a lover!
3011: At the crossroads, let him woo her:
3012: An old goat from Blocksberg, galloping over,
3013: Can bleat goodnight, as it passes by her.
3014: An honest man, of flesh and blood,                2115
3015: For a girl like that’s far too good.
3016: I’m not bothered even to say hello
3017: Except perhaps to break her window.
3018: 
3019: Brander (Pounding on the table.)
3020: 
3021: Quiet! Quiet! Or you won’t hear!
3022: I know about life, you lot, confess.              2120
3023: Besotted persons sit among us,
3024: As fits their status, then, I must
3025: Give them, tonight, of my very best.
3026: Listen! A song in the newest strain!
3027: And you can shout out the refrain!                2125
3028: 
3029: (He sings.)
3030: ‘Once there was a cellar rat,
3031: Who lived on grease, and butter:
3032: He had a belly, round and fat,
3033: Just like Doctor Luther.
3034: The cook set poison round about:        2130
3035: It brought on such a violent bout,
3036: As if he’d love inside him.’
3037: 
3038: Chorus (Shouting.)
3039: 
3040: ‘As if he’d love inside him!’
3041: 
3042: Brander
3043: 
3044: ‘He ran here, and he ran there,
3045: And drank from all the puddles,         2135
3046: Gnawing, scratching, everywhere,
3047: But nothing cured his shudders.
3048: In torment, he leapt to the roof,
3049: Poor beast, soon he’d had enough,
3050: As if he’d love inside him.’            2140
3051: 
3052: Chorus
3053: 
3054: ‘As if he’d love inside him!’
3055: 
3056: Brander
3057: 
3058: ‘Fear drove him to the light of day,
3059: Into the kitchen then he ran,
3060: Fell on the hearth and twitched away,
3061: Pitifully weak, and wan.                2145
3062: Then the murderess laughed with glee:
3063: He’s on his last legs, I see,
3064: As if he’d love inside him.’
3065: 
3066: Chorus
3067: 
3068: ‘As if he’d love inside him.’
3069: Siebel
3070: 
3071: How pleased they are, the tiresome fools!   2150
3072: Spreading poison for wretched rats,
3073: To me, that’s the right thing to do!
3074: 
3075: Brander
3076: 
3077: You’re in sympathy with them, perhaps?
3078: 
3079: Altmayer
3080: 
3081: That fat belly with a balding head!
3082: Bad luck makes him meek and mild:           2155
3083: From a swollen rat, he sees, with dread,
3084: His own natural likeness is compiled.
3085: 
3086: (Faust and Mephistopheles appear.)
3087: 
3088: First of all, I had to bring you here,
3089: Where cheerful friends sup together,
3090: To see how happily life slips away.         2160
3091: For these folk every day’s a holiday.
3092: With lots of leisure, and little sense,
3093: They revolve in their round-dance,
3094: Chasing their tails as kittens prance,
3095: If the hangovers aren’t too intense,        2165
3096: If the landlord gives them credit,
3097: They’re cheerful, and unworried by it.
3098: 
3099: Brander
3100: 
3101: They’re fresh from their travelling days,
3102: You can tell by their foreign ways:
3103: They’ve not been back an hour: you see.     2170
3104: Frosch
3105: 
3106: True, you’re right! My Leipzig’s dear to me!
3107: It’s a little Paris, and educates its people.
3108: 
3109: Siebel
3110: 
3111: Who do you think the strangers are?
3112: 
3113: Frosch
3114: 
3115: Let me find out! I’ll draw the truth,
3116: From those two, with a brimming glass,          2175
3117: As easily as you’d pull a child’s tooth.
3118: It seems to me they’re of some noble house,
3119: They look so discontented and so proud.
3120: 
3121: Brander
3122: 
3123: They’re surely strolling players, I’d guess!
3124: 
3125: Altmayer
3126: 
3127: Perhaps.
3128: 
3129: Frosch
3130: 
3131:    Watch me screw it out of them, then!         2180
3132: 
3133: Mephistopheles (To Faust.)
3134: 
3135: These folk wouldn’t feel the devil, even
3136: If he’d got them dangling by the neck.
3137: 
3138: Faust
3139: 
3140: Greetings, sirs!
3141: Siebel
3142: 
3143:                     Thank you, and greetings.
3144: 
3145: (He mutters away, inspecting Mephistopheles side-on.)
3146: 
3147: What’s wrong with his foot: why’s he limping?
3148: 
3149: Mephistopheles
3150: 
3151: Allow us to sit with you, if you please.                2185
3152: Instead of fine ale that can’t be had,
3153: We can still have good company.
3154: 
3155: Altmayer
3156: 
3157: You seem a choosy sort of lad.
3158: 
3159: Frosch
3160: 
3161: Was it late when you started out from Rippach?
3162: Perhaps you dined with Hans there, first?               2190
3163: 
3164: Mephistopheles
3165: 
3166: We passed straight by, today, without a rest!
3167: We spoke to him last some time back,
3168: When he talked a lot about his cousins,
3169: And he sent to each his kind greetings.
3170: 
3171: (He bows to Frosch.)
3172: 
3173: Altmayer (Aside.)
3174: 
3175: He did you, there! He’s smart!
3176: 
3177: Siebel
3178: 
3179:                A shrewd customer!                       2195
3180: Frosch
3181: 
3182: Wait, I’ll have him soon, I’m sure!
3183: 
3184: Mephistopheles
3185: 
3186: If I’m not wrong, we heard
3187: A tuneful choir singing?
3188: I’m sure, with this vault, the words
3189: Must really set it ringing!                              2200
3190: 
3191: Frosch
3192: 
3193: Are you by any chance a virtuoso?
3194: 
3195: Mephistopheles
3196: 
3197: No! Though my desire is great, my skill is only so-so.
3198: 
3199: Altmayer
3200: 
3201: Give us a song!
3202: 
3203: Mephistopheles
3204: 
3205:               If you wish it, a few.
3206: 
3207: Siebel
3208: 
3209: So long as it’s a brand-new one!
3210: 
3211: Mephistopheles
3212: 
3213: Well, it’s from Spain that we’ve just come,              2205
3214: The lovely land of wine, and singing too.
3215: 
3216: (He sings.)
3217: 
3218: ‘There was once a king, who
3219: Had a giant flea’ –
3220: Frosch
3221: 
3222: Listen! Did you get that? A flea.
3223: A flea’s an honest guest to me.            2210
3224: 
3225: Mephistopheles (Sings.)
3226: 
3227: ‘There was once a king, who
3228: Had a giant flea,
3229: He loved him very much, oh,
3230: He was like a son, you see.
3231: The king called for his tailor,            2215
3232: He came right away:
3233: Now, measure up the lad for
3234: A suit of clothes, I say!’
3235: 
3236: Brander
3237: 
3238: Make sure the tailor’s sharp,
3239: And cuts them out precisely,               2220
3240: And, since his son’s dear to his heart,
3241: Make sure there’s never a crease to see.
3242: 
3243: Mephistopheles
3244: 
3245: ‘All in silk and velvet,
3246: He was smartly dressed,
3247: With ribbons on his coat,                  2225
3248: A cross upon his chest.
3249: He was the First Minister,
3250: And so he wore a star:
3251: His brothers and his sisters,
3252: He made noblest by far.                    2230
3253: The lords and the ladies,
3254: They were badly smitten,
3255: The Queen and her maids,
3256: They were stung and bitten.
3257: They didn’t dare to crush them,                   2235
3258: Or scratch away, all night.
3259: We smother them, and crush them,
3260: The moment that they bite.’
3261: 
3262: Chorus (Shouted.)
3263: 
3264: ‘We smother them, and crush them,
3265: The moment that they bite.’                       2240
3266: 
3267: Frosch
3268: 
3269: Bravo! Bravo! That went sweetly!
3270: 
3271: Siebel
3272: 
3273: So shall it be with every flea!
3274: 
3275: Brander
3276: 
3277: Sharpen your nails, and crush them fine!
3278: 
3279: Altmayer
3280: 
3281: Long live freedom, and long live wine!
3282: 
3283: Mephistopheles
3284: 
3285: I’d love to drink a glass, in freedom’s honour,   2245
3286: If only the wine were a little better.
3287: 
3288: Siebel
3289: 
3290: Not again, we don’t want to hear!
3291: Mephistopheles
3292: 
3293: I fear the landlord might complain
3294: Or I’d give these worthy guests,
3295: One of my cellar’s very best.                      2250
3296: 
3297: Siebel
3298: 
3299: Just bring it on! He’ll accept it: I’ll explain.
3300: 
3301: Frosch
3302: 
3303: Make it a good glass and we’ll praise it.
3304: But don’t make it so small we can’t taste it.
3305: Because if I’m truly going to decide,
3306: I need a really big mouthful inside.               2255
3307: 
3308: Altmayer (Aside.)
3309: 
3310: They’re from the Rhine, as I guessed.
3311: 
3312: Mephistopheles
3313: 
3314: Bring me a corkscrew!
3315: 
3316: Brander
3317: 
3318:                       What for?
3319: Is it outside already, this cask?
3320: 
3321: Altmayer
3322: 
3323: There’s one in the landlord’s toolbox, for sure.
3324: 
3325: Mephistopheles (Takes the corkscrew. To Frosch.)
3326: 
3327: Now, what would you like to try?                   2260
3328: Frosch
3329: 
3330: What? Is there a selection, too?
3331: 
3332: Mephistopheles
3333: 
3334: There’s a choice for every one of you.
3335: 
3336: Altmayer (To Frosch.)
3337: 
3338: Ah! You soon catch on: your lips are dry?
3339: 
3340: Frosch
3341: 
3342: Good! When I’ve a choice, I drink Rhenish.
3343: The Fatherland grants those best gifts to us.                        2265
3344: 
3345: Mephistopheles (Boring a hole in the table-edge where Frosch is sitting.)
3346: 
3347: Bring me a little wax, to make the seals, as well!
3348: 
3349: Altmayer
3350: 
3351: Ah, that’s for the conjuring trick, I can tell.
3352: 
3353: Mephistopheles (To Brander.)
3354: 
3355: And yours?
3356: 
3357: Brander
3358: 
3359:    Champagne for me is fine:
3360: Make it a truly sparkling wine!
3361: 
3362: (Mephistopheles bores the holes: one of the others makes the wax stoppers
3363: and stops the holes with them.)
3364: We can’t always shun what’s foreign,                2270
3365: Things from far away are often fine.
3366: Real Germans can’t abide a Frenchman,
3367: And yet they gladly drink his wine.
3368: 
3369: Siebel (As Mephistopheles approaches his seat.)
3370: 
3371: I must confess I do dislike the dry,
3372: Give me a glass of the very sweetest!               2275
3373: 
3374: Mephistopheles (Boring a hole.)
3375: 
3376: I’ll pour an instant Tokay for you, yes?
3377: 
3378: Altmayer
3379: 
3380: Now, gentlemen, look me in the eye!
3381: I see you’ve had the better of us there.
3382: 
3383: Mephistopheles
3384: 
3385: Now! Now! With guests so rare,
3386: That would be far too much for me to dare.          2280
3387: Quick! Time for you to declare!
3388: Which wine can I serve you with?
3389: 
3390: Altmayer
3391: 
3392: Any at all! Don’t make us ask forever.
3393: 
3394: (Now all the holes have been stopped and sealed.)
3395: Mephistopheles (With a strange gesture.)
3396: 
3397: Grapes, they are the vine’s load!
3398: Horns, they are the he-goat’s:                                        2285
3399: Wine is juice: wood makes vines,
3400: The wooden board shall give us wine.
3401: Look deeper into Nature!
3402: Have faith, and here’s a wonder!
3403: Now draw the stoppers, and drink up!                                  2290
3404: 
3405: All (Draw the stoppers, and the wine they chose flows into each glass.)
3406: 
3407: O lovely fount, that flows for us!
3408: 
3409: Mephistopheles
3410: 
3411: But careful, don’t lose a drop!
3412: 
3413: (They drink repeatedly.)
3414: 
3415: All (Singing.)
3416: 
3417: ‘We’re all of us cannibals now,
3418: We’re like five hundred sows.’
3419: 
3420: Mephistopheles
3421: 
3422: The folk are free, and we can go, you see!                            2295
3423: 
3424: Faust
3425: 
3426: I’d like to leave here now.
3427: 
3428: Mephistopheles
3429: 
3430: Watch first: their bestiality
3431: Will make a splendid show.
3432: Siebel
3433: 
3434: (He drinks carelessly, wine pours on the ground and bursts into flame.)
3435: 
3436: Help! Fire! Hell burns bright!
3437: 
3438: Mephistopheles (Charming away the flame.)
3439: 
3440: Friendly element, be quiet!                                           2300
3441: 
3442: (To the drinkers.)
3443: 
3444: For this time, just a drop of Purgatory.
3445: 
3446: Siebel
3447: 
3448: What’s that? You wait! You’ll pay dearly!
3449: It seems you don’t quite see us right.
3450: 
3451: Frosch
3452: 
3453: Try playing that trick a second time, on us!
3454: 
3455: Altmayer
3456: 
3457: I think we should quietly send him packing.                           2305
3458: 
3459: Siebel
3460: 
3461: What, sir? You think you’re daring,
3462: Tricking us with your hocus-pocus?
3463: 
3464: Mephistopheles
3465: 
3466: Be quiet, old wine-barrel!
3467: 
3468: Siebel
3469: 
3470: You broomstick! You’ll show us you’re ill bred?
3471: Brander
3472: 
3473: Just wait, it’ll rain blows, on your head!                2310
3474: 
3475: Altmayer (Draws a stopper and fire blazes in his face.)
3476: 
3477: I’m burning! Burning!
3478: 
3479: Siebel
3480: 
3481:                        It’s magic, strike!
3482: The man’s a rascal! Kick him as you like!
3483: 
3484: (They draw knives and rush at Mephistopheles.)
3485: 
3486: Mephistopheles (With solemn gestures.)
3487: 
3488: Word and Image, ensnare!
3489: Alter, senses and air!
3490: Be here, and there!                                       2315
3491: 
3492: 
3493: (They look at each other, amazed.)
3494: 
3495: Altmayer
3496: 
3497: Where am I? What a lovely land!
3498: 
3499: Frosch
3500: 
3501: Vineyards? Am I seeing straight?
3502: 
3503: Siebel
3504: 
3505: And, likewise, grapes to hand!
3506: Brander
3507: 
3508: Deep in this green arbour, here,
3509: See, the vines! What grapes appear!
3510: 
3511: (He grasps Siebel by the nose: the others do the same reciprocally, and raise
3512: their knives.)
3513: 
3514: Mephistopheles
3515: 
3516: From their eyes, Error, take the iron band,                           2320
3517: And let them see how the Devil plays a joke.
3518: 
3519: (He vanishes with Faust: the revellers separate.)
3520: 
3521: Siebel
3522: 
3523: What’s happening?
3524: 
3525: Altmayer
3526:                    And how?
3527: 
3528: Frosch
3529:                                 Was that your nose?
3530: 
3531: Brander (To Siebel.)
3532: 
3533: And I’ve still got your nose in my hand!
3534: 
3535: Altmayer
3536: 
3537: It was a tremor, that passed through every limb!
3538: Pass me a stool: I’m sinking in!                                      2325
3539: 
3540: Frosch
3541: 
3542: Tell me: what happened there, my friend?
3543: Siebel
3544: 
3545: Where is he? When I catch that fellow,
3546: He won’t leave here alive again!
3547: 
3548: Altmayer
3549: 
3550: I saw him myself fly out of the cellar
3551: Riding on a barrel – and then –                    2330
3552: I feel there’s lead still in my feet.
3553: 
3554: (He turns towards the table.)
3555: 
3556: Ah! Does the wine still flow as sweet?
3557: 
3558: Siebel
3559: 
3560: It was deception, cheating, lying.
3561: 
3562: Frosch
3563: 
3564: Still, it seemed that I drank wine.
3565: 
3566: Brander
3567: 
3568: And what about all those grapes that hung there?   2335
3569: 
3570: Altmayer
3571: 
3572: Tell me, now, we shouldn’t believe in wonders!
3573: Part I Scene VI: The Witches’ Kitchen
3574: 
3575: (A giant cauldron stands on a low hearth, with a fire under it. Various
3576: shapes appear in the fumes from the cauldron. A She-Ape sits next to it,
3577: skimming it, watching to see it doesn’t boil over. The He-Ape, with young
3578: ones, sits nearby warming himself. The ceiling and walls are covered with
3579: the Witches’ grotesque instruments.)
3580: 
3581: Faust
3582: 
3583: These magical wild beasts repel me, too!
3584: Are you telling me I can be renewed,
3585: Wandering around in this mad maze,
3586: Demanding help from some old hag:                                    2340
3587: That her foul cookery will spirit away
3588: Thirty years from my age, just like that?
3589: It’s sad, if you know of nothing better!
3590: The star of hope has quickly set.
3591: Hasn’t some noble mind, or Nature,                                   2345
3592: Found some wondrous potion yet?
3593: 
3594: Mephistopheles
3595: 
3596: My friend, what you say, again, is intelligent!
3597: There’s a natural means to make you younger:
3598: But it’s written, in a book quite different,
3599: And in an odd chapter.                                               2350
3600: 
3601: Faust
3602: 
3603: I’ll know it, then.
3604: 
3605: Mephistopheles
3606: 
3607: Fine! You’ve a method here that needs
3608: No gold, no doctor, no magician:
3609: Take yourself off to the nearest field,
3610: To scratch around, and hoe, and dig in,
3611: Maintain yourself, and constrain                                     2355
3612: Your senses in a narrow sphere:
3613: Feed yourself on the purest fare,
3614: Be a beast among beasts: think it no robbery,
3615: To manure the fields you harvest, there:
3616: Since that’s the best of ways, believe me,      2360
3617: To keep your youth for eighty years!
3618: 
3619: Faust
3620: 
3621: I’m not used to it, can’t condescend,
3622: To take a spade in hand, and bend:
3623: That narrow life wouldn’t suit me at all.
3624: 
3625: Mephistopheles
3626: 
3627: So you must call the witch then, after all.     2365
3628: 
3629: Faust
3630: 
3631: Why is that old witch necessary!
3632: Why can’t you, yourself, make the brew?
3633: 
3634: Mephistopheles
3635: 
3636: What a lovely occupation for me!
3637: And build a thousand bridges, meanwhile, too.
3638: It’s not just art and science that tell,        2370
3639: Patience is needed in the work as well.
3640: A calm mind’s busy years in its creation,
3641: Only time strengthens the fermentation.
3642: And everything about it
3643: Is quite a peculiar show!                       2375
3644: It’s true the Devil taught it:
3645: The Devil can’t make it though.
3646: 
3647: (Seeing the creatures.)
3648: 
3649: See what a dainty race I hail!
3650: This is the female: this is the male!
3651: (To the creatures.)
3652: 
3653: The mistress isn’t home, I say?                2380
3654: 
3655: The Creatures
3656: 
3657: Feasting away,
3658: Gone today,
3659: The Chimney way!
3660: 
3661: Mephistopheles
3662: 
3663: How long will she be swarming?
3664: 
3665: The Creatures
3666: 
3667: As long as our paws are warming.               2385
3668: 
3669: Mephistopheles (To Faust.)
3670: 
3671: What do you think of these tender creatures?
3672: 
3673: Faust
3674: 
3675: As rude as any I ever saw!
3676: 
3677: Mephistopheles
3678: 
3679: Ah, but to me this kind of discourse
3680: Shows the most delightful features!
3681: 
3682: (To the creatures.)
3683: 
3684: Accursed puppets, tell me true,                2390
3685: What are you stirring in that brew?
3686: 
3687: The Creatures
3688: 
3689: We’re cooking up thick beggars’ soup.
3690: Mephistopheles
3691: 
3692: Then there’ll be thousands in the queue.
3693: 
3694: The He-Ape (Approaches and fawns on Mephistopheles.)
3695: 
3696: O, throw the dice quick,
3697: And let me be rich!                                                 2395
3698: I’ll be the winner!
3699: It’s all arranged badly,
3700: And if I had money,
3701: I’d be a thinker.
3702: 
3703: Mephistopheles
3704: 
3705: Why does the ape think he’d be lucky,                               2400
3706: If he’d only a chance to try the lottery!
3707: 
3708: (Meanwhile the young apes have been playing with a large ball, and they
3709: roll it forward.)
3710: 
3711: The He-Ape
3712: 
3713: The world’s a ball
3714: It lifts to fall,
3715: Rolls without rest:
3716: Rings like glass,                                                   2405
3717: And breaks as fast!
3718: It’s hollow at best.
3719: It’s shining here,
3720: Here, what’s more:
3721: ‘I am living!’                                                      2410
3722: A place dear son,
3723: To keep far from!
3724: You must die!
3725: Its clay will soon
3726: In pieces, lie.                                                     2415
3727: Mephistopheles
3728: 
3729: Why the sieve?
3730: 
3731: The He-Ape (Lifting it down.)
3732: 
3733: If you were a thief
3734: I’d know you this minute.
3735: 
3736: (He runs to the She-Ape, and lets her look through the sieve.)
3737: 
3738: Look through the sieve!                                          2420
3739: Can you see the thief,
3740: But daren’t name him?
3741: 
3742: Mephistopheles (Approaching the fire.)
3743: 
3744: And this pot?
3745: 
3746: The He-Ape and She-Ape
3747: 
3748: What a silly lot!
3749: Not to know a pot,
3750: Not to know a kettle!                                            2425
3751: 
3752: Mephistopheles
3753: 
3754: Rude creature!
3755: 
3756: The He-Ape
3757: 
3758: Take this brush here,
3759: And sit on the settle.
3760: 
3761: (He invites Mephistopheles to sit down.)
3762: Faust (Who all this time has been standing in front of a mirror, alternately
3763: approaching it and distancing himself from it.)
3764: 
3765: What do I see? What heavenly form
3766: Is this that the magic mirror brings!                                  2430
3767: Love, lend me your swiftest wings,
3768: Then bear me to fields she adorns!
3769: Ah, if I do not stand still here,
3770: If I dare to venture nearer,
3771: I see as if through a mist, no clearer –                               2435
3772: The loveliest form of Woman, there!
3773: Is it possible: can Woman be so lovely?
3774: Must I, in her outspread body, declare
3775: The incarnation of all that’s heavenly?
3776: Can any such this earth deliver?                                       2440
3777: 
3778: Mephistopheles
3779: 
3780: Naturally, if a God torments himself six days,
3781: And says to himself, Bravo, at last, in praise,
3782: He must have made something clever.
3783: See, this time, what will satisfy you, forever:
3784: I’ll know how to fish that treasure out for you,                       2445
3785: Happy, the one who finds good fortune in her,
3786: And carries her home again, as his bride, too.
3787: 
3788: (Faust gazes endlessly in the mirror. Mephistopheles stretches himself on the
3789: settle, plays with the brush, and continues to speak.)
3790: 
3791: Here I sit like a king on his throne,
3792: The sceptre’s here, but where’s the crown?
3793: 
3794: The Creatures (Who up till now have been making all kinds of grotesque
3795: movements together, bring Mephistopheles a crown, with great outcry.)
3796: 
3797: Oh, with sweat and with blood,                                         2450
3798: If you’ll be so good,
3799: Glue on this crown, sublime!
3800: (They are awkward with the crown, and snap it in two pieces, with which
3801: they leap about.)
3802: 
3803: Now that’s out of the way!
3804: We see, and we say,
3805: We hear, and we rhyme -                                              2455
3806: 
3807: Faust (In front of the mirror.)
3808: 
3809: Ah! I’ll go completely mad.
3810: 
3811: Mephistopheles (Pointing to the creatures.)
3812: 
3813: Now my head’s almost spinning.
3814: 
3815: The Creatures
3816: 
3817: If our luck’s not bad,
3818: If there’s sense to be had,
3819: We must be thinking!                                                 2460
3820: 
3821: Faust (As before.)
3822: 
3823: My heart pains me with its burning! Quick,
3824: Let’s leave this place, forego it!
3825: 
3826: Mephistopheles (Still in the same position.)
3827: 
3828: Well, at least one must admit
3829: That they’re honest poets.
3830: 
3831: (The cauldron that the She-Ape has forgotten to keep a watch on, now boils
3832: over: a great flame flares from the chimney. The Witch comes careering
3833: down through the flames, with horrendous cries.)
3834: 
3835: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!                                                      2465
3836: Damned creature! Accursed sow!
3837: You left the kettle: you’ve singed me now!
3838: Accursed creature!
3839: (Seeing Faust and Mephistopheles.)
3840: 
3841: What have we here?
3842: Who are you, here?                                                  2470
3843: What do you want?
3844: Who creeps unknown?
3845: The fire’s pain own
3846: In all your bone!
3847: 
3848: (She plunges the skimming-ladle into the cauldron, and scatters flame
3849: towards Faust, Mephistopheles and the Creatures. The Creatures whimper.)
3850: 
3851: Mephistopheles (Reversing the brush he holds in his hand, and striking
3852: among the jars and glasses.)
3853: 
3854: One, two! One, two!
3855: There lies the brew!
3856: There lies the glass!
3857: A joke at last,
3858: In time, she-ass,
3859: To your melody, too.                                                2480
3860: 
3861: (As the Witch starts back in Anger and Horror.)
3862: 
3863: Do you know me? Skeleton! Scarecrow!
3864: Do you know your lord and master?
3865: What stops me from striking you, so,
3866: Crushing you, and your ape-creatures?
3867: Have you no respect for a scarlet coat?                             2485
3868: Don’t you understand a cockerel’s feather?
3869: Have I hidden my face, you old she-goat?
3870: Have I to name myself, as ever?
3871: 
3872: The Witch
3873: 
3874: Oh sir, forgive the rude welcome!
3875: I don’t see a single foot cloven.                                   2490
3876: And your two ravens - are where?
3877: Mephistopheles
3878: 
3879: This once, you get away with it:
3880: It’s truly a good while, isn’t it,
3881: Since we’ve been seen together.
3882: And Civilisation makes men level,            2495
3883: It even sticks to the Devil:
3884: That Northern demon is no more:
3885: Who sees horns now, or tail or claw?
3886: As for the feet, which I can’t spare,
3887: That would harm me with the people.          2500
3888: So like many a youth, now, I wear,
3889: False calves and false in-steps, as well.
3890: 
3891: The Witch (Dancing.)
3892: 
3893: Sense and reason flee my brain,
3894: I see young Satan here again!
3895: 
3896: Mephistopheles
3897: 
3898: Woman, I forbid that name!                   2505
3899: 
3900: The Witch
3901: 
3902: Why? What harm is caused so?
3903: 
3904: Mephistopheles
3905: 
3906: It’s written in story books, always:
3907: Men are no better for it, though:
3908: The Evil One’s gone: the evil stays.
3909: Call me the Baron: that sounds good:         2510
3910: I’m a gentleman, like the other gentlemen.
3911: Perhaps you doubt my noble blood:
3912: See, here’s the crest I carry, then!
3913: 
3914: (He makes an indecent gesture.)
3915: The Witch (Laughing immoderately.)
3916: 
3917: Ha! Ha! That’s your way, as ever.
3918: You’re the same rogue forever!             2515
3919: 
3920: Mephistopheles (To Faust.)
3921: 
3922: My friend, take note: learn that this is
3923: The proper way to handle witches.
3924: 
3925: The Witch
3926: 
3927: Now, gentlemen, say how I can be of use.
3928: 
3929: Mephistopheles
3930: 
3931: A good glass of your well-known juice!
3932: But I must insist on the oldest:           2520
3933: The years double what it can do.
3934: 
3935: The Witch
3936: 
3937: Gladly! Here’s a flask, on the shelf:
3938: I sometimes drink from it myself,
3939: And it doesn’t really stink at all:
3940: I’ll gladly give him a glass or so.        2525
3941: 
3942: (Whispering.)
3943: 
3944: If he drinks it unprepared, recall,
3945: He won’t live a single hour, though.
3946: 
3947: Mephistopheles
3948: 
3949: He’s my good friend: it’ll go down well:
3950: Don’t begrudge the best of your kitchen.
3951: Draw the circle: speak the speech, then    2530
3952: Offer him a glass full!
3953: (The Witch draws a circle with fantastic gestures, and places mysterious
3954: articles inside it: meanwhile the glasses start to ring, and the cauldron to
3955: echo, and make music. Finally she brings a large book, sits the Apes in a
3956: ring, who serve as a reading desk and hold torches. She beckons Faust to
3957: approach.)
3958: 
3959: Faust (To Mephistopheles.)
3960: 
3961: Tell me, now, what’s happening?
3962: These wild gestures, crazy things,
3963: All of this tasteless trickery,
3964: Is known, and hateful enough to me.                                      2535
3965: 
3966: Mephistopheles
3967: 
3968: A farce! You should be laughing:
3969: Don’t be such a serious fellow!
3970: This hocus-pocus she, the doctor’s, making,
3971: So you’ll be aided by the juice to follow.
3972: 
3973: (He persuades Faust to enter the circle.)
3974: 
3975: The Witch (Begins to declaim from the book, with much emphasis.)
3976: 
3977: You shall see, then!                                                     2540
3978: From one make ten!
3979: Let two go again,
3980: Make three even,
3981: You’re rich again.
3982: Take away four!                                                          2545
3983: From five and six,
3984: So says the Witch,
3985: Make seven and eight,
3986: So it’s full weight:
3987: And nine is one,                                                         2550
3988: And ten is none.
3989: This is the Witch’s one-times-one!
3990: Faust
3991: 
3992: I’m in the dark, the hag babbles with fever.
3993: 
3994: Mephistopheles
3995: 
3996: There’s still more she’s not gone over,
3997: I know it well, the whole book’s like this:    2555
3998: I’ve wasted time on it before, though,
3999: A perfect contradiction in terms is
4000: Ever a mystery to the wise: fools more so.
4001: My friend, the art’s both old and new,
4002: It’s like this in every age, with two          2560
4003: And one, and one and two,
4004: Scattering error instead of truth.
4005: Men prattle, and teach it undisturbed:
4006: Who wants to be counted with the fools?
4007: Men always believe, when they hear words,      2565
4008: There must be thought behind them, too.
4009: 
4010: The Witch (Continuing.)
4011: 
4012: The highest skill,
4013: The science, still
4014: Is hidden from the rabble!
4015: One who never thought,                         2570
4016: To him it’s brought,
4017: He owns it without trouble.
4018: 
4019: Faust
4020: 
4021: Why talk this nonsense to us?
4022: My head’s near split in two.
4023: It seems I hear the chorus,                    2575
4024: Of a hundred thousand fools.
4025: Mephistopheles
4026: 
4027: Enough, enough, O excellent Sibyl!
4028: Bring the drink along: and fill
4029: The cup, quick, to the very brim:
4030: The drink will bring my friend no harm:                                2580
4031: He’s a man of many parts, and him
4032: Many a noble draught has charmed.
4033: 
4034: (The Witch, ceremoniously, pours the drink into a cup: as Faust puts it to his
4035: lips, a gentle flame rises.)
4036: 
4037: Down it quickly! Every time! It’ll
4038: Likewise, warm your heart, entire.
4039: You’re hand in hand with the Devil:                                    2585
4040: Will you shrink before the fire?
4041: 
4042: (The Witch breaks the circle. Faust steps out.)
4043: 
4044: Now, quick, away! You may not rest.
4045: 
4046: The Witch
4047: 
4048: Much good may that potion do you!
4049: 
4050: Mephistopheles (To the Witch.)
4051: 
4052: On Walpurgis Night you can tell me best,
4053: What favour I can return to you.                                       2590
4054: 
4055: The Witch
4056: 
4057: Here’s a song! Sing it sometimes, and you,
4058: Will feel a peculiar effect: don’t ask me how.
4059: 
4060: Mephistopheles (To Faust.)
4061: 
4062: Come on, quickly, run about now:
4063: You need to sweat, that will allow
4064: The power to penetrate, through and through.                           2595
4065: Later, I’ll teach you to value leisure,
4066: And soon you’ll find with deepest pleasure,
4067: How Cupid stirs, and, now and then, leaps, too.
4068: 
4069: Faust
4070: 
4071: Let me look quickly in the glass, once more!
4072: How lovely that woman’s form, I descried!         2600
4073: 
4074: Mephistopheles
4075: 
4076: No! No! The paragon of all women, you’re
4077: About to see before you, personified.
4078: 
4079: (Aside.)
4080: 
4081: With that drink in your body, well then,
4082: All women will look to you like Helen.
4083: Part I Scene VII: A Street
4084: 
4085: (Faust. Margaret, passing by.)
4086: 
4087: Faust
4088: 
4089: Lovely lady, may I offer you               2605
4090: My arm, and my protection, too?
4091: 
4092: Margaret
4093: 
4094: Not lovely, nor the lady you detected,
4095: I can go home, unprotected.
4096: 
4097: (She releases herself and exits.)
4098: 
4099: Faust
4100: 
4101: By Heavens, the child is lovely!
4102: I’ve never seen anything more so.          2610
4103: She’s virtuous, yet innocently
4104: Pert, and quick-tongued though.
4105: Her rosy lips, her clear cheeks,
4106: I’ll not forget them in many a week!
4107: The way she cast down her eyes,            2615
4108: Deep in my heart, imprinted, lies:
4109: How curt in her speech she was,
4110: Well that was quite charming, of course!
4111: 
4112: (Mephistopheles enters.)
4113: 
4114: Listen, you must get that girl for me!
4115: 
4116: Mephistopheles
4117: 
4118: Which one?
4119: Faust
4120:              The girl who just went by.        2620
4121: 
4122: Mephistopheles
4123: 
4124: That one, there? She’s come from the priest,
4125: Absolved of all her sins, while I
4126: Crept into a stall nearby:
4127: She is such an innocent thing,
4128: She’s no need to sit confessing:               2625
4129: I’ve no power with such as those, I mean!
4130: 
4131: Faust
4132: 
4133: Yet, she’s older than fourteen.
4134: 
4135: Mephistopheles
4136: 
4137: Now you’re speaking like some Don Juan
4138: Who wants every flower for himself alone,
4139: Conceited enough to think there’s no honour,   2630
4140: To be plucked except by him, nor favour:
4141: But that’s never the case, you know.
4142: 
4143: Faust
4144: 
4145: Master Moraliser is that so?
4146: With me, best leave morality alone!
4147: I’m telling you, short and sweet,              2635
4148: If that young heart doesn’t beat
4149: Within my arms, tonight - so be it,
4150: At midnight, then our pact is done.
4151: 
4152: Mephistopheles
4153: 
4154: Think, what a to and fro it will take!
4155: I need at least fourteen days, to make         2640
4156: Some kind of opportunity to meet her.
4157: Faust
4158: 
4159: If I’d seven hours at my call,
4160: I’d not need the Devil at all,
4161: To seduce such a creature.
4162: 
4163: Mephistopheles
4164: 
4165: You’re almost talking like a Frenchman:       2645
4166: But don’t let yourself get all annoyed:
4167: What’s the use if she’s only part enjoyed?
4168: Your happiness won’t be as prolonged,
4169: As if you were to knead and fashion
4170: That little doll, with every passion,         2650
4171: Up and down, as yearning preaches,
4172: And many a cunning rascal teaches.
4173: 
4174: Faust
4175: 
4176: I’ve enough appetite without all that.
4177: 
4178: Mephistopheles
4179: 
4180: Now, without complaint or jesting, what
4181: I’m telling you is, with this lovely child,   2655
4182: Once and for all, you mustn’t be wild.
4183: She won’t be taken by storm, I said:
4184: We’ll need to use cunning instead.
4185: 
4186: Faust
4187: 
4188: Get me a part of the angels’ treasure!
4189: Lead me to where she lies at leisure!         2660
4190: Get me a scarf from her neck: aspire
4191: To a garter, that’s my heart’s desire.
4192: Mephistopheles
4193: 
4194: So you can see how I will strain
4195: To help you, and ease your pain,
4196: We’ll not let an instant slip away,                    2665
4197: I’ll lead you to her room today.
4198: 
4199: Faust
4200: 
4201: And shall I see her? And have her?
4202: 
4203: Mephistopheles
4204: 
4205: No! She has to visit a neighbour.
4206: Meanwhile, you can be alone there,
4207: With every hope of future pleasure,                    2670
4208: Enjoy her breathing space, at leisure.
4209: 
4210: Faust
4211: 
4212: Can we go?
4213: 
4214: Mephistopheles
4215: 
4216:          Her room’s not yet free.
4217: 
4218: Faust
4219: 
4220: Look for a gift for her, from me!
4221: 
4222:                                          (He exits.)
4223: 
4224: Mephistopheles
4225: 
4226: A present? Good! He’s sure to work it!
4227: I know many a lovely place, up here,                   2675
4228: And many an ancient buried treasure:
4229: I must have a look around for a bit.
4230:                                      (He exits.)
4231: Part I Scene VIII: Evening,
4232: A small well-kept room.
4233: 
4234: (Margaret, plaiting and fastening the braids of her hair.)
4235: 
4236: Margaret
4237: 
4238: I’d give anything if I could say
4239: Who that gentleman was, today!
4240: He’s brave for certain, I could see,                         2680
4241: And from some noble family:
4242: That his face readily told –
4243: Or he wouldn’t have been so bold.
4244: 
4245: (She exits.) (Mephistopheles and Faust appear.)
4246: 
4247: Mephistopheles
4248: 
4249: Come in: but quietly, I mean!
4250: 
4251: Faust (After a moment’s silence.)
4252: 
4253: I’d ask you, now, to leave me be!                            2685
4254: 
4255: Mephistopheles (Poking about.)
4256: 
4257: Not every girl keeps thing so clean.
4258: 
4259: (Mephistopheles exits.)
4260: 
4261: Faust
4262: 
4263: Welcome, sweet twilight glow,
4264: That weaves throughout this shrine!
4265: Sweet love-pangs grip my heart so,
4266: That on hope’s dew must live, and pine!                      2690
4267: How a breath of peace breathes around,
4268: Its order, and contentment!
4269: In this poverty, what wealth is found!
4270: In this prison, what enchantment!
4271: (He throws himself into a leather armchair near the bed.)
4272: 
4273: Accept me now, you, who with open arms                      2695
4274: Gathered joy and pain, in past days, where,
4275: How often, ah, with all their childish charms
4276: The little flock hung round their father’s chair!
4277: There my beloved, perhaps, cheeks full, stands,
4278: Grateful for all the gifts of Christmas fare,               2700
4279: Kissing her grandfather’s withered hands.
4280: Sweet girl, I feel your spirit, softly stray,
4281: Through the wealth of order, all around me,
4282: That with motherliness instructs, each day,
4283: The tablecloth to lie smooth, at your say,                  2705
4284: And even the wrinkled sand beneath your feet.
4285: O beloved hand, so goddess-like!
4286: This house because of you is Heaven’s like.
4287: And here!
4288: 
4289: (He lifts one of the bed curtains.)
4290: 
4291:         What grips me with its bliss!
4292: Here I could stand, slowly lingering.                       2710
4293: Here, Nature, in its gentlest dreaming,
4294: Formed an earthly angel within this.
4295: Here the child lay! Life, warm,
4296: Filled her delicate breast,
4297: And here, in pure and holy form,                            2715
4298: A heavenly image was expressed!
4299: And I! What leads me here?
4300: Why do I feel so deeply stirred?
4301: What do I seek? Why such a heavy heart?
4302: Poor Faust! I no longer know who you are.                   2720
4303: Is there a magic fragrance round me?
4304: I urged myself on, to the deepest delight,
4305: And feel myself melt in Love’s dreaming flight!
4306: Are we the sport of every lightest breeze?
4307: And if she appeared at this instant,                        2725
4308: How to atone for being so indiscreet?
4309: The great man, alas, of little moment!
4310: Would lie here, melting, at her feet.
4311: 
4312: Mephistopheles (Appearing.)
4313: 
4314: Quick! I see her coming, there.
4315: 
4316: Faust
4317: 
4318: Away! Away! I’ll not return again.                         2730
4319: 
4320: Mephistopheles
4321: 
4322: Here’s a casket fairly loaded, then,
4323: I’ve taken it from elsewhere.
4324: Put it just here on the chest,
4325: I swear it’ll dazzle her, when she sees:
4326: I’ve put in some trinkets, and the rest,                   2735
4327: For you to win another, if you please.
4328: Truly, a child’s a child, and play is play.
4329: 
4330: Faust
4331: 
4332: I don’t know, shall I?
4333: 
4334: Mephistopheles
4335: 
4336:                       Are you asking, pray?
4337: Perhaps you’d like to keep the treasure, too?
4338: Then I’d advise your Lustfulness,                          2740
4339: To spare the sweet hours of brightness,
4340: And spare me a heap of trouble over you.
4341: I hope that you’re not full of meanness!
4342: I scratch my head: I rub my hands –
4343: 
4344: (He places the casket in the chest, and shuts it again.)
4345: 
4346: Now off we go, and go quickly!                             2745
4347: Through this you’ll bend the child, you see,
4348: To your wish and will: as any fool understands:
4349: Yet now you seem to me
4350: As if you were heading for the lecture hall, and see
4351: Standing there grey-faced, in front of you,            2750
4352: Physics, and Metaphysics too!
4353: Now, away!
4354: 
4355: (They exit.)
4356: 
4357: (Margaret with a lamp.)
4358: 
4359: Margaret
4360: 
4361: It’s so close and sultry, here,
4362: 
4363: (She opens the window.)
4364: 
4365: And yet it’s not warm outside.
4366: It troubles me so, I don’t know why –                  2755
4367: I wish that Mother were near.
4368: A shudder ran through my whole body –
4369: I’m such a foolish girl, so timid!
4370: 
4371: (She begins to sing, while undressing.)
4372: 
4373: ‘There was a king in Thule, he
4374: Was faithful, to the grave,                            2760
4375: To whom his dying lady
4376: A golden goblet gave.
4377: 
4378: He valued nothing greater:
4379: At every feast it shone:
4380: His tears were brimming over,                          2765
4381: When he drank there-from.
4382: 
4383: When he himself was dying
4384: No towns did he with-hold,
4385: No wealth his heir denying,
4386: Except the cup of gold.                                2770
4387: He gave a royal banquet,
4388: His knights around him, all,
4389: In his sea-girt turret,
4390: In his ancestral hall.
4391: 
4392: There the old king stood, yet,                                         2775
4393: Drinking life’s last glow:
4394: Then threw the golden goblet
4395: Into the waves below.
4396: 
4397: He saw it falling, drowning,
4398: Sinking in the sea,                                                    2780
4399: Then, his eyelids closing,
4400: Never again drank he.’
4401: 
4402: (She opens the chest in order to arrange her clothes, and sees the casket.)
4403: 
4404: How can this lovely casket be here? I’m sure
4405: I locked the chest when I was here before.
4406: It’s quite miraculous! What can it hold in store?                      2785
4407: Perhaps someone brought it as security,
4408: And my mother’s granted a loan on it?
4409: There’s a ribbon hanging from it, there’s a key,
4410: I’m quite determined to open it.
4411: What’s here? Heavens! What a show,                                     2790
4412: More than I’ve ever seen in all my days!
4413: A jewel box! A noble lady might glow
4414: With all of these on high holidays!
4415: How would this chain look? This display
4416: Of splendour: who owns it, it’s so fine?                               2795
4417: 
4418: (She puts the jewellery on and stands in front of the mirror.)
4419: 
4420: If only the earrings were mine!
4421: At once one looks so different.
4422: What makes us beautiful, young blood?
4423: All that’s fine and good,
4424: But it’s discounted, in the end,                                       2800
4425: They praise us half in pity.
4426: To gold they tend,
4427: On gold depend,
4428: All things! Oh, poverty!
4429: Part I Scene IX: Promenade
4430: 
4431: (Faust walking about pensively. Mephistopheles appears.)
4432: 
4433: Mephistopheles
4434: 
4435: Scorned by all love! And by hellfire! What’s worse?        2805
4436: I wish I knew: I could use it in a curse!
4437: 
4438: Faust
4439: 
4440: What’s wrong? What’s pinching you so badly?
4441: I never, in all my life, saw such a face!
4442: 
4443: Mephistopheles
4444: 
4445: I’d pack myself off to the Devil, in disgrace,
4446: If I weren’t a Devil myself already!                       2810
4447: 
4448: Faust
4449: 
4450: Is something troubling your brain?
4451: It’s fitting that you’ve a raging pain.
4452: 
4453: Mephistopheles
4454: 
4455: To think, the priest should get his hands on
4456: Jewellery that was meant for Gretchen!
4457: Her mother snatched it up, to see,                         2815
4458: And was gripped by secret anxiety.
4459: That woman’s a marvellous sense of smell,
4460: From nosing round in her prayer-book too well,
4461: And sniffs things, ever and again,
4462: To see if they’re holy or profane:                         2820
4463: And about the jewels, she felt, that’s clear,
4464: There’s not much of a blessing here.
4465: ‘My child,’ she said, ‘ill-gotten goods
4466: Snare the soul, and dissipate the blood.
4467: We’ll dedicate it to the Virgin,                           2825
4468: She’ll repay us with manna from Heaven!’
4469: Margaret, grimacing wryly, was quite put out:
4470: Thinking: ‘Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth,
4471: He’s not a godless man, nor one to fear,
4472: He who left these fine things here.’               2830
4473: Her mother let the parson in:
4474: He’d scarcely let the game begin
4475: Before his eyes filled with enjoyment.
4476: He said: ‘So we see aright, we sinners,
4477: Who overcome themselves are winners.               2835
4478: The Church has a healthy stomach, when,
4479: It gobbles up lands, and don’t forget,
4480: It’s never over-eaten yet.
4481: The Church alone, dear lady, could
4482: Always digest ill-gotten goods.’                   2840
4483: 
4484: Faust
4485: 
4486: That’s a universal custom, too, my friend,
4487: With all those who rule, and those who lend.
4488: 
4489: Mephistopheles
4490: 
4491: Then he took the bangles, chains and rings,
4492: As if they were merely trifling things,
4493: Thanked her too, no less nor more                  2845
4494: Than if it were a sack of nuts one wore.
4495: Promised them their reward when they died,
4496: And left them suitably edified.
4497: 
4498: Faust
4499: 
4500: And Gretchen?
4501: 
4502: Mephistopheles
4503: 
4504:                 Sits there, restlessly, still
4505: Not knowing what she should do, or will,           2850
4506: Thinks of the jewels night and day,
4507: But more of him who placed them in her way.
4508: Faust
4509: 
4510: The dear girl’s sadness brings me pain.
4511: Find some jewels for her, again!
4512: Those first were not so fine, I’d say.           2855
4513: 
4514: Mephistopheles
4515: 
4516: Oh yes, to gentlemen it’s child’s play!
4517: 
4518: Faust
4519: 
4520: Fix it: arrange it, as I want you to,
4521: Attach yourself to her neighbour, too!
4522: Don’t be a devil made of clay,
4523: Get her fresh jewels straight away!              2860
4524: 
4525: 
4526: Mephistopheles
4527: 
4528: Yes, gracious sir, gladly, with all my heart.
4529: 
4530: (Faust exits.)
4531: 
4532: Such a lovesick fool would blow up the Sun,
4533: High up in the air, with the Moon and Stars,
4534: To provide his sweetheart with some diversion.
4535: 
4536: (He exits.)
4537: Part I Scene X: The Neighbour’s House
4538: 
4539: Martha (Alone.)
4540: 
4541: God forgive that man I love so well,            2865
4542: He hasn’t done right by me at all!
4543: Off into the world he’s gone,
4544: And left me here, in the dust, alone.
4545: Truly I did nothing to grieve him,
4546: I gave him, God knows, fine loving.             2870
4547: 
4548: (She weeps.)
4549: 
4550: Perhaps, he’s even dead! – Yet, oh!
4551: If I’d only his death certificate to show!
4552: 
4553: (Margaret enters.)
4554: 
4555: Margaret
4556: 
4557: Martha!
4558: 
4559: Martha
4560:      My little Gretchen, what’s happened?
4561: 
4562: Margaret
4563: 
4564: My legs are giving way beneath me!
4565: I’ve found another box of jewellery             2875
4566: In the chest: it’s of ebony, fashioned,
4567: Full of quite splendid things,
4568: And richer than the first, I think.
4569: 
4570: Martha
4571: 
4572: You’d better not tell your mother:
4573: She’ll give it to the Church, like the other.   2880
4574: Margaret
4575: 
4576: Ah, See now! See what a show!
4577: 
4578: Martha (Dressing her with jewels.)
4579: 
4580: O you’re a lucky creature, though!
4581: 
4582: Margaret
4583: 
4584: I can’t wear them in the street, alas,
4585: Nor be seen like this, at Mass.
4586: 
4587: Martha
4588: 
4589: Come often then, to me, as before:             2885
4590: You can put them on, here, secretly:
4591: Stand, for an hour, in front of the mirror,
4592: We’ll take delight in them privately.
4593: Then give us a holiday, an occasion,
4594: When people can see a fraction of them.        2890
4595: A chain first, then a pearl in the ear: your
4596: Mother won’t know, say you’d them before.
4597: 
4598: Margaret
4599: 
4600: Who could have left the second casket?
4601: There’s something not proper about it!
4602: 
4603: (A knock.)
4604: 
4605: Good God! Is it my mother, then?               2895
4606: 
4607: Martha (Looking through the shutter.)
4608: 
4609: It’s a stranger, a gentleman – Come in!
4610: (Mephistopheles enters.)
4611: 
4612: Mephistopheles
4613: 
4614: In introducing myself so freely,
4615: I ask you ladies to excuse me.
4616: 
4617: (He steps back reverently on seeing Margaret.)
4618: 
4619: It’s Martha Schwerdtlein I seek!
4620: 
4621: Martha
4622: 
4623: I’m she, what do you wish with me?               2900
4624: 
4625: Mephistopheles (Aside to her.)
4626: 
4627: I know you now: that’s enough for me:
4628: You’ve a distinguished visitor there, I see.
4629: Pardon the liberty I’ve taken, pray,
4630: I’ll return this afternoon, if I may.
4631: 
4632: Martha (Aloud.)
4633: 
4634: To think, child: of all things: just fancy!      2905
4635: The gentleman takes you for a lady.
4636: 
4637: Margaret
4638: 
4639: I’m a poor young thing he’ll find:
4640: Heavens! The gentleman’s far too kind:
4641: The jewels and trinkets aren’t mine.
4642: 
4643: Mephistopheles
4644: 
4645: Ah, it’s not just the jewellery, mind:           2910
4646: The look: the manner: she has a way!
4647: I’m pleased that I’m allowed to stay.
4648: Martha
4649: 
4650: What brings you here? I wish that you –
4651: 
4652: Mephistopheles
4653: 
4654: I wish I brought you happier news! –
4655: This news I hope you’ll forgive me repeating:   2915
4656: Your husband’s dead, but sends a greeting.
4657: 
4658: Martha
4659: 
4660: He’s dead? That true heart! Oh!
4661: My man is dead! I’ll die, also!
4662: 
4663: Margaret
4664: 
4665: Ah! Dear lady, don’t despair!
4666: 
4667: Mephistopheles
4668: 
4669: Hear the mournful tale I bear!                  2920
4670: 
4671: Margaret
4672: 
4673: That’s why I’ll never love while I’ve breath,
4674: Such a loss would grieve me to death.
4675: 
4676: Mephistopheles
4677: 
4678: Joy must have sorrows: sorrow its joys, too.
4679: 
4680: Martha
4681: 
4682: Tell me of his last hours: ah tell me!
4683: Mephistopheles
4684: 
4685: He’s buried in Padua, close to              2925
4686: The blessed Saint Anthony,
4687: In a consecrated space,
4688: A cool eternal resting place.
4689: 
4690: Martha
4691: 
4692: Have you brought nothing else, from him?
4693: 
4694: Mephistopheles
4695: 
4696: Yes a request, it’s large and heavy:        2930
4697: For you to sing a hundred masses for him!
4698: Otherwise, no, my pocket’s empty.
4699: 
4700: Martha
4701: 
4702: What? No piece of show? No jewellery?
4703: What every workman has in his purse,
4704: And keeps with him as his reserve,          2935
4705: Rather than having to starve or beg!
4706: 
4707: Mephistopheles
4708: 
4709: Madam, it’s a heavy grief to me:
4710: But truly his money wasn’t wasted.
4711: And then, he felt his errors greatly,
4712: Yes, and bemoaned his bad luck lately.      2940
4713: 
4714: Margaret
4715: 
4716: Ah! How unlucky all men are! I’ll
4717: Be sure to offer many a prayer for him.
4718: 
4719: Mephistopheles
4720: 
4721: You’re worthy of soon marrying:
4722: You’re such a kindly child.
4723: Margaret
4724: 
4725: Oh, no! That wouldn’t do as yet.                      2945
4726: 
4727: Mephistopheles
4728: 
4729: If not a husband, a lover, while you wait.
4730: It’s heaven’s greatest charm,
4731: To have a dear one on one’s arm.
4732: 
4733: Margaret
4734: 
4735: That’s not the custom of the country.
4736: 
4737: Mephistopheles
4738: 
4739: Custom or not! It seems to be.                        2950
4740: 
4741: Martha
4742: 
4743: Go on with your tale!
4744: 
4745: Mephistopheles
4746: 
4747:               I stood beside his death-bed,
4748: Hardly better than a rubbish-tip, poor man,
4749: Of half-rotten straw: yet he died a Christian,
4750: And found that he was even further in debt.
4751: ‘Alas,’ he cried, ‘I hate myself, with good reason,   2955
4752: For leaving, as I did, my wife and my occupation!
4753: Ah the memory of that is killing me,
4754: Would in this life I might be forgiven, though!’
4755: 
4756: Martha (Weeping.)
4757: 
4758: The dear man! I forgave him long ago.
4759: Mephistopheles
4760: 
4761: ‘Although, God knows, she was more to blame than me.’   2960
4762: 
4763: Martha
4764: 
4765: The liar! What! At death’s door, lies he was telling!
4766: 
4767: Mephistopheles
4768: 
4769: In his last wanderings, he was rambling,
4770: If I’m any judge myself of the thing.
4771: ‘I had,’ he said, ‘no time to gaze in play:
4772: First children, then bread for them each day,           2965
4773: And I mean bread in the wider sense:
4774: And couldn’t even eat my share in silence.’
4775: 
4776: Martha
4777: 
4778: Did he forget the love, the loyalty,
4779: My drudgery, night and day!
4780: 
4781: Mephistopheles
4782: 
4783: Not at all, he thought of it deeply, in his way.        2970
4784: He said: ‘As I was leaving Malta
4785: I prayed hard for my wife and children:
4786: And favour came to me from heaven,
4787: Since our ship took a Turkish cutter,
4788: Carrying the great Sultan’s treasure.                   2975
4789: There was a reward for bravery,
4790: And I received, in due measure,
4791: The generous share that fell to me.’
4792: 
4793: Martha
4794: 
4795: What? And where? Has he buried it by chance?
4796: Mephistopheles
4797: 
4798: Who can tell: the four winds know the circumstance.   2980
4799: A lovely girl there took him on,
4800: As he, a stranger, roamed round Naples:
4801: She gave him loyalty, and loved the man,
4802: And he felt it so, till his last hour fell.
4803: 
4804: Martha
4805: 
4806: He stole from his children, and his wife!             2985
4807: The rogue! All the pain and misery he met,
4808: Couldn’t keep him from that shameful life!
4809: 
4810: Mephistopheles
4811: 
4812: Ah, but: now he’s died of it!
4813: If I were truly in your place,
4814: I’d mourn him quietly for a year,                     2990
4815: And look, meanwhile, for a dear new face.
4816: 
4817: Martha
4818: 
4819: Ah, sweet God! I’ll not easily find another,
4820: In all the world, such as my first one was!
4821: There never was a dearer fool than mine.
4822: Only he loved roaming too much, at last,              2995
4823: And foreign women, and foreign wine,
4824: And the rolling of those cursed dice.
4825: 
4826: Mephistopheles
4827: 
4828: Well, that would have still been fine,
4829: If, with you, he’d followed that line,
4830: And noticed nothing, on your side.                    3000
4831: I swear that, with that same condition,
4832: I’d swap rings with you, no question!
4833: Martha
4834: 
4835: O, the gentleman’s pleased to jest!
4836: 
4837: Mephistopheles (To himself.)
4838: 
4839: I must fly from here, swift as a bird!
4840: She might hold the Devil to his word.                3005
4841: 
4842: (To Gretchen.)
4843: 
4844: How does your heart feel? At rest?
4845: 
4846: Margaret
4847: 
4848: What does the gentleman mean?
4849: 
4850: Mephistopheles (To himself.)
4851: 
4852:                           Sweet, innocent child!
4853: 
4854: (Aloud.)
4855: 
4856: Farewell, ladies!
4857: 
4858: Margaret
4859:              Farewell!
4860: 
4861: Martha
4862:                      Oh, speak to me yet, a while!
4863: I’d like a witness, as to where, how, and when
4864: My darling man died and was buried: then,            3010
4865: As I’ve always been a friend of tradition,
4866: Put his death in the paper, the weekly edition.
4867: Mephistopheles
4868: 
4869: Yes, dear lady, two witnesses you need
4870: To verify the truth, or so all agree:
4871: I’ve a rather fine companion,            3015
4872: He can be your second man.
4873: I’ll bring him here.
4874: 
4875: Martha
4876:                    Oh yes, please do!
4877: 
4878: Mephistopheles
4879: 
4880: That young lady will be here, too?
4881: He’s a brave youth! Travelled, yes,
4882: And with ladies he’s all politeness.     3020
4883: 
4884: Margaret
4885: 
4886: I’d be shamed before the gentleman.
4887: 
4888: Mephistopheles
4889: 
4890: Not before any king on earth, madam.
4891: 
4892: Martha
4893: 
4894: Behind the house, then, in my garden,
4895: Tonight: we’ll expect you gentlemen.
4896: Part I Scene XI: The Street
4897: 
4898: (Faust. Mephistopheles.)
4899: 
4900: Faust
4901: 
4902: How goes it? Will it be? Will it soon be done?         3025
4903: 
4904: Mephistopheles
4905: 
4906: Ah, bravo! Do I find you all on fire?
4907: In double-quick time you’ll have your desire.
4908: You’ll meet tonight, at her neighbour Martha’s home:
4909: There’s a woman, who’s the thing,
4910: For procuring and for gipsying!                        3030
4911: 
4912: Faust
4913: 
4914: All right!
4915: 
4916: Mephistopheles
4917:     But, she needs something from us, too.
4918: 
4919: Faust
4920: 
4921: One good turn deserves another, true.
4922: 
4923: Mephistopheles
4924: 
4925: We only have to bear a valid witness,
4926: That her husband’s outstretched members bless
4927: A consecrated place in Padua.                          3035
4928: 
4929: Faust
4930: 
4931: Brilliant! We must first make the journey there!
4932: Mephistopheles
4933: 
4934: Sacred Simplicity! There’s no need to do that.
4935: Just testify, without saying too much to her.
4936: 
4937: Faust
4938: 
4939: If you can’t do better than that, your pact I’ll tear.
4940: 
4941: Mephistopheles
4942: 
4943: O holy man! Now I see you there!                         3040
4944: Is it the first time in your life, come swear,
4945: That you’ve ever born false witness?
4946: Haven’t you shown skill in definition
4947: Of God, the World, what’s in it, Men,
4948: What moves them, in mind and breast?                     3045
4949: With impudent brow, and swollen chest?
4950: And if you look at it more deeply, oh yes,
4951: Did you know as much now - confess,
4952: As you do about Herr Schwerdtlein’s death?
4953: 
4954: Faust
4955: 
4956: You are, and you’ll remain, a Liar and a Sophist.        3050
4957: 
4958: Mephistopheles
4959: 
4960: Yes when no one’s the wiser for it.
4961: This coming morn, in all honour though,
4962: Won’t you beguile poor Gretchen so:
4963: And swear you love her with all your soul?
4964: 
4965: Faust
4966: 
4967: From my heart.
4968: Mephistopheles
4969: 
4970:                    Well, and good!                3055
4971: And will your eternal Truth and Love,
4972: Your one all-powerful Force, above –
4973: Flow from your heart, too, as it should?
4974: 
4975: Faust
4976: 
4977: Stop! Stop! It will! If I but feel,
4978: For that emotion, for that throng,                3060
4979: Seek the name, that none reveal,
4980: Roam, with senses, through the world.
4981: Seize on every highest word,
4982: And call the fire, that I’m tasting,
4983: Endless, eternal, everlasting –                   3065
4984: Does that to some devil’s game of lies belong?
4985: 
4986: Mephistopheles
4987: 
4988: Yet, I’m still right!
4989: 
4990: Faust
4991: 
4992:                      Hear one thing more,
4993: I beg you, and spare my breath – the one
4994: Who wants to hold fast, and has a tongue,
4995: He’ll hold for sure.                              3070
4996: Come, chattering fills me with disgust,
4997: And then you’re right, especially since I must.
4998: Part I Scene XII: The Garden
4999: 
5000: (Margaret on Faust’s arm, Martha and Mephistopheles walking up and
5001: down.)
5002: 
5003: I know the gentleman flatters me,
5004: Lowers himself, and shames me, too.
5005: A traveller is used to being                               3075
5006: Content, out of courtesy, with any food.
5007: I know too well, so learned a man,
5008: Can’t feed himself on my poor bran.
5009: 
5010: Faust
5011: 
5012: A glance, a word from you, feeds me more,
5013: Than all the world’s wisest lore.                          3080
5014: 
5015: (He kisses her hand.)
5016: 
5017: Margaret
5018: 
5019: Don’t trouble yourself! How could you kiss it?
5020: It’s such a nasty, rough thing!
5021: What work haven’t I done with it!
5022: My mother’s so exacting.
5023: 
5024: (They move on.)
5025: 
5026: Martha
5027: 
5028: And you, sir, you’re always travelling?                           3085
5029: 
5030: Mephistopheles
5031: 
5032: Ah, work and duty are such a bother!
5033: There’s many a place one’s sad at leaving,
5034: And daren’t stay a moment longer!
5035: Martha
5036: 
5037: In youth it’s fine, up and down,
5038: Flitting about, the whole world over:            3090
5039: Then harsher days come round,
5040: And lonely bachelors small joy discover,
5041: In sliding towards their hole in the ground.
5042: 
5043: Mephistopheles
5044: 
5045: I view the prospect with horror.
5046: 
5047: Martha
5048: 
5049: Then take advice in time, dear sir.              3095
5050: 
5051: (They move on.)
5052: 
5053: Margaret
5054: 
5055: Yes, out of sight is out of mind!
5056: Politeness comes naturally to you:
5057: But you’ll meet friends, often, who,
5058: Are more sensible than me, you’ll find.
5059: 
5060: Faust
5061: 
5062: Dearest, believe me, what men call sense,        3100
5063: Is often just vanity and short-sightedness.
5064: 
5065: Margaret
5066:                                        How so?
5067: 
5068: Faust
5069: 
5070: Ah, that simplicity and innocence never know
5071: Themselves, or their heavenly worth!
5072: That humble meekness, the highest grace
5073: That Nature bestows so lovingly –                3105
5074: Margaret
5075: 
5076: It’s only for a moment that you think of me,
5077: I’ve plenty of time to dream about your face.
5078: 
5079: Faust
5080: 
5081: You’re often alone, then?
5082: 
5083: Margaret
5084: 
5085: Yes, our household’s a little one,
5086: Yet it has to be cared for by someone.          3110
5087: We have no servant: I sweep, knit, sew,
5088: And cook, I’m working early and late:
5089: And in everything my mother is so
5090: Strict, and straight.
5091: Not that she has to be quite so economical:     3115
5092: We could be more generous than others:
5093: My father left a little fortune for us:
5094: A house and garden by the town-wall.
5095: But now my days are spent quietly:
5096: My brother is a soldier: I’d                    3120
5097: A younger sister who died.
5098: The trouble I had with that child:
5099: Yet I’d take it on again, the worry,
5100: She was so dear to me.
5101: 
5102: Faust
5103:                    An angel, if like you.
5104: 
5105: Margaret
5106: 
5107: I raised her, and she loved me too.             3125
5108: After my father died, she was born,
5109: We gave mother up for lost, so worn
5110: And wretchedly she lay there then,
5111: And slowly, day by day, grew well again.
5112: She couldn’t think of feeding                   3130
5113: It herself: that poor little thing,
5114: And so I nursed it all alone,
5115: On milk and water, as if it were my own,
5116: In my arms, in my lap,
5117: It charmed me, tumbling, and grew fat.               3135
5118: 
5119: Faust
5120: 
5121: You found your greatest happiness there, for sure.
5122: 
5123: Margaret
5124: 
5125: But also truly many a weary hour.
5126: The baby’s cradle stood at night
5127: Beside my bed: and if it hardly stirred
5128: I woke outright:                                     3140
5129: Now I nursed it, now laid it beside me: heard
5130: When it cried, and left my bed, and often
5131: Danced it back and forth, in the room: and then,
5132: At break of dawn stood at the washtub, again:
5133: Then the market and the kitchen, oh,                 3145
5134: And every day just like tomorrow.
5135: One sometimes lacks the courage, sir, and yet
5136: One appreciates one’s food and rest.
5137: 
5138: (They move on.)
5139: 
5140: Martha
5141: 
5142: Women have the worst of it: it’s true:
5143: A bachelor is hard to change, you see.               3150
5144: 
5145: Mephistopheles
5146: 
5147: That just depends on the likes of you,
5148: The right teacher might improve me.
5149: 
5150: Martha
5151: 
5152: Say, have you never found anyone, dear sir?
5153: Has your heart never been captured, anywhere?
5154: Mephistopheles
5155: 
5156: The proverb says: A hearth of your own,             3155
5157: And a good wife, are worth pearls and gold.
5158: 
5159: Martha
5160: 
5161: I mean: have you never felt desire, even lightly?
5162: 
5163: Mephistopheles
5164: 
5165: I’ve everywhere been treated most politely.
5166: 
5167: Martha
5168: 
5169: I meant to say: were you never seriously smitten?
5170: 
5171: Mephistopheles
5172: 
5173: With ladies, one should never dare be flippant.     3160
5174: 
5175: Martha
5176: 
5177: Ah, you won’t understand me!
5178: 
5179: Mephistopheles
5180:           I am sorry! Yet you’ll find
5181: I understand – that you are very kind.
5182: 
5183: (They move on.)
5184: 
5185: Faust
5186: 
5187: And, Angel, did you recognise me again,
5188: As soon as I appeared in the garden?
5189: 
5190: Margaret
5191: 
5192: Didn’t you see my gaze drop then?                   3165
5193: Faust
5194: 
5195: And you forgive the liberty I’ve taken,
5196: The impertinence of it all,
5197: Just as you were leaving the Cathedral?
5198: 
5199: Margaret
5200: 
5201: I was flustered, such a thing’s never happened to me:
5202: ‘Ah’, I thought, ‘has he seen, in your behaviour,               3170
5203: Something that’s impertinent or improper?
5204: No one could ever say anything bad about me.
5205: He seems to be walking suddenly, with you,
5206: As though he dealt with a girl of easy virtue’.
5207: I confess, I didn’t know what it was, though,                   3175
5208: That I began to feel, and to your advantage too,
5209: But certainly I was angry with myself, oh,
5210: That I could not be angrier with you.
5211: 
5212: Faust
5213: 
5214: Sweet darling!
5215: 
5216: Margaret
5217: 
5218: Wait a moment!
5219: 
5220: (She picks a Marguerite and pulls the petals off one by one.)
5221: 
5222: Faust
5223:                    What’s that for, a bouquet?
5224: 
5225: Margaret
5226: 
5227: No, it’s a game.
5228: 
5229: Faust
5230:                    What?
5231: Margaret
5232:                       No, you’ll laugh if I say!    3180
5233: 
5234: (She pulls off the petals, murmuring to herself.)
5235: 
5236: Faust
5237: 
5238: What are you whispering?
5239: 
5240: Margaret (Half aloud.)
5241: 
5242:          He loves me – he loves me not.
5243: 
5244: Faust
5245: 
5246: You sweet face that Heaven forgot!
5247: 
5248: Margaret (Continuing.)
5249: 
5250: Loves me – Not – Loves me – Not
5251: 
5252: (She plucks the last petal with delight.)
5253: 
5254: He loves me!
5255: 
5256: Faust
5257: 
5258:             Yes, my child! Let this flower-speech
5259: Be heaven’s speech to you. He loves you!            3185
5260: Do you know what that means? He loves you!
5261: 
5262: (He grasps her hands.)
5263: 
5264: Margaret
5265: 
5266: I’m trembling!
5267: 
5268: Faust
5269:                     Don’t tremble, let this look,
5270: Let this clasping of hands tell you
5271: What’s inexpressible:                                                   3190
5272: To give oneself wholly, and feel
5273: A joy that must be eternal!
5274: Eternal! – Its end would bring despair.
5275: No, no end! No end!
5276: 
5277: (Margaret presses his hand, frees herself, and runs away. He stands a
5278: moment in thought: then follows her.)
5279: 
5280: Martha (Coming forward.)
5281: 
5282: Night is falling.
5283: 
5284: Mephistopheles
5285: 
5286:              Yes, and we must away.                            3195
5287: 
5288: Martha
5289: 
5290: I’d ask you to remain here longer,
5291: But this is quite a wicked place.
5292: It’s as if they had nothing to do yonder,
5293: And no work they should be doing
5294: But watching their neighbours’ to-ing and fro-ing,                      3200
5295: And whatever one does, insults are hurled.
5296: And our couple, now?
5297: 
5298: Mephistopheles
5299: 
5300:                Flown up the passage, there.
5301: Wilful little birds!
5302: 
5303: Martha
5304: 
5305:                     He seems keen on her.
5306: 
5307: Mephistopheles
5308: 
5309: And she on him. It’s the way of the world.
5310: Part I Scene XIII: An Arbour in the Garden
5311: 
5312: (Margaret comes in, hides behind the door of the garden-house, holds her
5313: fingers to her lips, and peeps through the gaps.)
5314: 
5315: Margaret
5316: 
5317: He’s coming.
5318: 
5319: Faust (Appearing.)
5320: 
5321:               Ah, rascal, you tease me so! I’ve got you!            3205
5322: 
5323: (He kisses her.)
5324: 
5325: Margaret (Clasping him, and returning the kiss.)
5326: 
5327: Dearest man! With all my heart I love you!
5328: 
5329: (Mephistopheles knocks.)
5330: 
5331: Faust (Stamping his foot in frustration.)
5332: 
5333: Who’s there?
5334: 
5335: Mephistopheles
5336: 
5337:         A dear friend!
5338: 
5339: Faust
5340:               A creature!
5341: 
5342: 
5343: Mephistopheles
5344:                                  It’s time to go.
5345: Martha (Appearing.)
5346: 
5347: Yes, sir, it’s late!
5348: 
5349: Faust
5350: 
5351:         May I keep company with you, though?
5352: 
5353: Margaret
5354: 
5355: My mother would tell me, – Farewell!
5356: 
5357: Faust
5358:                                         Must I go, then?
5359: Farewell!
5360: 
5361: Martha
5362: 
5363:                Goodbye, now!
5364: 
5365: Margaret
5366: 
5367:                                And soon to meet again!     3210
5368: 
5369: (Faust and Mephistopheles exit.)
5370: 
5371: Margaret
5372: 
5373: Dear God! That one man, by thinking,
5374: Can know everything, oh, everything!
5375: I stand in front of him, ashamed
5376: And just say yes to all he says.
5377: I’m such a poor, ignorant child, and he -                  3215
5378: I can’t understand what he sees in me.
5379: Part I Scene XIV: Forest and Cavern
5380: 
5381: 
5382: (Faust, alone.)
5383: 
5384: Sublime spirit, you gave me all, all,
5385: I asked for. Not in vain have you
5386: Revealed your face to me in flame.
5387: You gave me Nature’s realm of splendour,      3220
5388: With the power to feel it, and enjoy.
5389: Not merely as a cold, awed stranger,
5390: But allowing me to look deep inside,
5391: Like seeing into the heart of a friend.
5392: You lead the ranks of living creatures        3225
5393: Before me, showing me my brothers
5394: In the silent woods, the air, the water.
5395: And when the storm roars in the forest,
5396: When giant firs fell their neighbours,
5397: Crushing nearby branches in their fall,       3230
5398: Filling the hills with hollow thunder,
5399: You lead me to the safety of a cave,
5400: Show me my own self, and reveal
5401: Your deep, secret wonders in my heart.
5402: And when the pure Moon, to my eyes,           3235
5403: Rises, calming me, the silvery visions
5404: Of former times, drift all around me,
5405: From high cliffs, and moist thickets,
5406: Tempering thought’s austere delight.
5407: Oh, I know now that nothing can be            3240
5408: Perfect for Mankind. You gave me,
5409: With this joy, that brings me nearer,
5410: Nearer to the gods, a companion,
5411: Whom I can no longer do without,
5412: Though he is impudent, and chilling,
5413: Degrades me in my own eyes, and with          3245
5414: A word, a breath, makes your gifts nothing.
5415: He fans a wild fire in my heart,
5416: Always alive to that lovely form.
5417: So I rush from desire to enjoyment,
5418: And in enjoyment pine to feel desire.         3250
5419: (Mephistopheles enters.)
5420: 
5421: Mephistopheles
5422: 
5423: Haven’t you had enough of this life yet?
5424: How can you be happy all this time?
5425: It’s fine for a man to try it for a bit,
5426: But then you need a newer clime!
5427: 
5428: Faust
5429: 
5430: I wish you’d something else to do,            3255
5431: Than plague me on a good day.
5432: 
5433: Mephistopheles
5434: 
5435: Now, now! I’d gladly ignore you,
5436: You don’t really mean it anyway.
5437: You’d be little loss to me,
5438: A rude, mad, sour companion.                  3260
5439: One’s hands are full all day, and see,
5440: What pleases you, or what to let be,
5441: No one can tell from your expression.
5442: 
5443: Faust
5444: 
5445: So that’s the tone he takes!
5446: I’m to thank him, for boring me.              3265
5447: 
5448: Mephistopheles
5449: 
5450: Poor Son of Earth, how could you make
5451: Your way through life without me?
5452: I’ve cured you for a while at least
5453: Of your twitches of imagination,
5454: If I weren’t here, you’d certainly            3270
5455: Have walked right off this earthly station.
5456: In rocky hollows, in a hole,
5457: Why sit around here, like an owl?
5458: From soaking moss and dripping stone,
5459: Sucking your nourishment, like a toad?                3275
5460: Spend your time sweeter, better!
5461: Your body’s still stuck there with the Doctor.
5462: 
5463: Faust
5464: 
5465: Do you understand the new power of being
5466: That a walk in the wilderness can bring?
5467: But then, if you were able to guess,                  3280
5468: You’re devil enough to begrudge my happiness.
5469: 
5470: Mephistopheles
5471: 
5472: An other-worldly pleasure.
5473: Night and day, mountains for leisure.
5474: Clasping heaven and earth, blissfully,
5475: Inflating yourself, becoming a deity.                 3285
5476: With expectant urge burrowing through earth’s core,
5477: Feeling all that six days’ work, in yours,
5478: To taste who knows what, in power’s pride,
5479: Overflowing, almost, with the joy of life,
5480: Vanishing, the Earthly Son,                           3290
5481: And into some deep Intuition –
5482: 
5483: (With a gesture.)
5484: 
5485: I can’t say how – passing inside.
5486: 
5487: Faust
5488: 
5489: Fie, on you!
5490: 
5491: Mephistopheles
5492: 
5493:              Ah, you don’t like it from me!
5494: You’ve the right, to say ‘fie’ to me, politely.
5495: Before chaste ears men daren’t speak aloud,           3295
5496: That which chaste hearts can’t do without:
5497: Short and sweet, I begrudge the pleasure you get
5498: From occasionally lying to yourself, about it.
5499: But you won’t hold out for long, I’m sure.
5500: You’re already over-driven,                      3300
5501: Sooner or later you’ll be given
5502: To madness, or to fear and horror.
5503: Enough! Your lover sits inside,
5504: All is dull, oppressive to her,
5505: She can’t get you out of her mind,               3305
5506: Her deep love overwhelms her.
5507: First your love’s flood round her flowed,
5508: As a stream pours from melted snow:
5509: You’ve so filled her heart, and now,
5510: Your stream again is shallow.                    3310
5511: Instead of enthroning yourself in the wood,
5512: Let the great gentleman do some good,
5513: To that poor little ape of flesh and blood,
5514: And reward her, I think, for her love.
5515: Her days seem pitifully long:                    3315
5516: She sits at the window, cloud drifting
5517: Over the old City wall, sees it lifting.
5518: ‘Would I were a little bird!’ runs her song,
5519: All day long, and all night long.
5520: Sometimes lively, mostly not,                    3320
5521: Sometimes crying out, in tears,
5522: Then quiet again, it appears,
5523: And always in love.
5524: 
5525: Faust
5526: 
5527: You snake! You snake, you!
5528: 
5529: Mephistopheles
5530: 
5531: A touch! That caught you!                        3325
5532: Faust
5533: 
5534: Wretch! Be gone from my presence:
5535: Don’t name that lovely girl to me!
5536: Don’t bring desire for that sweet body
5537: Before every half-maddened sense!
5538: 
5539: Mephistopheles
5540: 
5541: Well, what then? She thinks you’ve flown away,     3330
5542: And, half and half, you already have, I’d say.
5543: 
5544: Faust
5545: 
5546: I’m near her, and were I still far,
5547: I can’t lose her or forget her,
5548: I even envy the body of our Lord,
5549: When her lips touch it at the altar.               3335
5550: 
5551: Mephistopheles
5552: 
5553: Quite so, my friend! My envy often closes
5554: On that pair of twins that feed among the roses.
5555: 
5556: Faust
5557: 
5558: Away from me, procurer!
5559: 
5560: Mephistopheles
5561: 
5562:          Fine, you curse and I must smile.
5563: The god who made both man and woman,
5564: He likewise knew the noblest profession,           3340
5565: So made the opportunity as well.
5566: Go on, it’s a crying shame!
5567: Since you’re bound, all the same
5568: For your lover’s room, not death.
5569: Faust
5570: 
5571: Where is the heavenly joy in her arms?             3345
5572: Let me warm myself with her charms!
5573: Do I not always feel her absent breath?
5574: Am I not the fugitive? The homeless one?
5575: The creature without aim or rest,
5576: A torrent in the rocks, still thundering down,     3350
5577: Foaming eagerly into the abyss?
5578: And she beside it, with vague childlike mind,
5579: In a hut there, on a little Alpine field,
5580: So, her first homely life you’d find,
5581: Hidden there in that little world.                 3355
5582: And I, the god-forsaken,
5583: Was not great enough,
5584: To grasp the cliffs, and take them,
5585: And crush them into dust!
5586: I still must undermine her peaceful life!          3360
5587: You, Hell, must have your sacrifice.
5588: Help, Devil, curtail the anxious moment brewing.
5589: What must be, let it be, and swiftly!
5590: Let her fate also fall on me,
5591: And she and I rush to ruin!                        3365
5592: 
5593: Mephistopheles
5594: 
5595: Again it glows: again it seethes!
5596: Go in and comfort her, you fool!
5597: When a brain, like yours, no exit sees,
5598: It calls it the end of all things, too.
5599: Praise him who keeps his courage fresh!            3370
5600: Or you’ll soon get quite be-devilled, there.
5601: I find nothing in the world so tasteless,
5602: As a Devil, in despair.
5603: Part I Scene XV: Gretchen’s Room
5604: 
5605: (Gretchen alone at the spinning wheel.)
5606: 
5607: ‘My peace is gone,
5608: My heart is sore:                         3375
5609: I’ll find it, never,
5610: Oh, nevermore.
5611: 
5612: When he’s not here,
5613: My grave is near,
5614: The world is all,                         3380
5615: A bitter gall.
5616: 
5617: My poor head
5618: Feels crazed to me.
5619: My poor brain
5620: Seems dazed to me.                        3385
5621: 
5622: My peace is gone,
5623: My heart is sore:
5624: I’ll find it, never,
5625: Oh, nevermore.
5626: 
5627: Only to see him                           3390
5628: I look out.
5629: Only to meet him,
5630: I leave the house.
5631: 
5632: His proud steps,
5633: His noble figure,                         3395
5634: His smiling lips,
5635: His eyes: their power.
5636: 
5637: And all his speech
5638: Like magic is,
5639: His fingers’ touch,                       3400
5640: And, oh, his kiss!
5641: My peace is gone,
5642: My heart is sore:
5643: I’ll find it, never,
5644: Oh, nevermore.         3405
5645: 
5646: My heart aches
5647: To be with him,
5648: Oh if I could
5649: Cling to him,
5650: 
5651: And kiss him,          3410
5652: The way I wish,
5653: So I might die,
5654: At his kiss!
5655: Part I Scene XVI: Martha’s Garden
5656: 
5657: (Margaret. Faust.)
5658: 
5659: Margaret
5660: 
5661: Promise me, Heinrich!
5662: 
5663: Faust
5664:                               If I can!
5665: 
5666: Margaret
5667: 
5668: Say, as regards religion, how you feel.              3415
5669: I know that you are a dear, good man,
5670: Yet, for you, it seems, it has no appeal.
5671: 
5672: Faust
5673: 
5674: Leave that alone, child! You feel I’m kind to you:
5675: For Love I’d give my blood, my life too.
5676: I’ll rob no man of his church and faith.             3420
5677: 
5678: Margaret
5679: 
5680: That’s not right, we must have faith.
5681: 
5682: Faust
5683: 
5684: Must we?
5685: 
5686: Margaret
5687: 
5688:       Ah, if in this I was only fluent!
5689: You don’t respect the Holy Sacrament.
5690: 
5691: Faust
5692: 
5693: I respect it.
5694: Margaret
5695: 
5696:   Without wanting it, though. You’ve passed
5697: So many years without confession, or mass.    3425
5698: Do you believe in God?
5699: 
5700: Faust
5701: 
5702:               My darling, who dare say:
5703: ‘I believe in God’?
5704: Choose priest to ask, or sage,
5705: The answer would seem a joke, would it not,
5706: Played on whoever asks?
5707: 
5708: Margaret
5709: 
5710:                   So, you don’t believe?      3430
5711: 
5712: Faust
5713: 
5714: Sweetest being, don’t misunderstand me!
5715: Who dares name the nameless?
5716: Or who dares to confess:
5717: ‘I believe in him’?
5718: Yet who, in feeling,                          3435
5719: Self-revealing,
5720: Says: ‘I don’t believe’?
5721: The all-clasping,
5722: The all-upholding,
5723: Does it not clasp, uphold,                    3440
5724: You: me, itself?
5725: Don’t the heavens arch above us?
5726: Doesn’t earth lie here under our feet?
5727: And don’t the eternal stars, rising,
5728: Look down on us in friendship?                3445
5729: Are not my eyes reflected in yours?
5730: And don’t all things press
5731: On your head and heart,
5732: And weave, in eternal mystery,
5733: Visibly: invisibly, around you?                    3450
5734: Fill your heart from it: it is so vast,
5735: And when you are blessed by the deepest feeling,
5736: Call it then what you wish,
5737: Joy! Heart! Love! God!
5738: I have no name                                     3455
5739: For it! Feeling is all:
5740: Names are sound and smoke,
5741: Veiling Heaven’s bright glow.
5742: 
5743: Margaret
5744: 
5745: That’s all well and good, I know,
5746: The priest says much the same,                     3460
5747: Only, in slightly different words.
5748: 
5749: Faust
5750: 
5751: It’s what all hearts, say, everywhere
5752: Under the heavenly day,
5753: Each in its own speech:
5754: And why not I in mine?                             3465
5755: 
5756: Margaret
5757: 
5758: Listening to you, it almost seems quite fine,
5759: Yet something still seems wrong, to me,
5760: Since you don’t possess Christianity.
5761: 
5762: Faust
5763: 
5764: Dear child!
5765: 
5766: Margaret
5767: 
5768:       I’ve long been grieved
5769: To see you in such company.                        3470
5770: Faust
5771: 
5772: Why, who?
5773: 
5774: Margaret
5775: 
5776: That man who hangs round you so,
5777: I hate him in my innermost soul:
5778: Nothing in all my life has ever
5779: Given my heart such pain, no, never,
5780: As his repulsive face has done.            3475
5781: 
5782: Faust
5783: 
5784: Don’t be afraid of him, sweet one!
5785: 
5786: Margaret
5787: 
5788: His presence here, it chills my blood.
5789: To every other man I wish good:
5790: But much as I’m longing to see you
5791: I’ve a secret horror of seeing him, too,   3480
5792: I’ve thought him a rogue, all along!
5793: God forgive me, if I do him wrong!
5794: 
5795: Faust
5796: 
5797: There have to be such odd fellows.
5798: 
5799: Margaret
5800: 
5801: I’d rather not live with such as those!
5802: Once he’s inside the door, again,          3485
5803: He looks around in a mocking way,
5804: And half-severely:
5805: You can see he’s not at all in sympathy:
5806: It’s written on his forehead even,
5807: That there’s no spirit of love within.     3490
5808: I’m so happy in your arms,
5809: Free, untroubled, and so warm,
5810: Yet I’m stifled in his presence.
5811: 
5812: Faust
5813: 
5814: You angel, full of presentiments!
5815: 
5816: Margaret
5817: 
5818: It oppresses me, so deeply, too,                3495
5819: That when he meets with us, wherever,
5820: I feel that I no longer love you.
5821: Ah I can’t pray when he’s there,
5822: And that gnaws inside me: oh,
5823: Heinrich, for you too, surely it’s so.          3500
5824: 
5825: Faust
5826: 
5827: It’s merely an antipathy!
5828: 
5829: Margaret
5830: 
5831: I must go now.
5832: 
5833: Faust
5834: 
5835:                     Ah, will there never be
5836: An hour where I can clasp you to my heart,
5837: And heart to heart, and soul, to soul impart?
5838: 
5839: Margaret
5840: 
5841: Ah, if I only slept alone!                      3505
5842: For you, I’d gladly draw the bolt tonight:
5843: But my mother hears the slightest tone,
5844: And if we were caught outright,
5845: I’d die on the selfsame spot!
5846: Faust
5847: 
5848: You angel: no need for that.                       3510
5849: Here is a little phial to keep!
5850: Three drops of this, in her drink, she’ll take,
5851: And Nature will favour her with deepest sleep.
5852: 
5853: Margaret
5854: 
5855: What would I not do for your sake?
5856: I hope that it won’t harm her though!              3515
5857: 
5858: Faust
5859: 
5860: Would I advise it, Love, if it were so?
5861: 
5862: Margaret
5863: 
5864: Ah, I only have to see you, dearest man,
5865: And something bends me to your will,
5866: For you, so much, I have already done,
5867: Little remains for me to do for you still.         3520
5868: 
5869: (She exits.)
5870: 
5871: (Mephistopheles enters.)
5872: 
5873: The little monkey! Has it gone?
5874: 
5875: Faust
5876: 
5877:           Spying again, are you?
5878: 
5879: Mephistopheles
5880: 
5881: I’ve heard in infinite detail, how
5882: The Doctor works his catechism through,
5883: And I hope it does you good, now.
5884: Girls are always so keen to review                 3525
5885: Whether one’s virtuous, and sticks to the rules.
5886: They think if a man can be led, he’ll follow too.
5887: 
5888: Faust
5889: 
5890: Monster, you can’t see
5891: How this true loving soul,
5892: Full of a belief,                                   3530
5893: That is wholly
5894: Her salvation, torments herself so,
5895: In case her lover should be lost indeed.
5896: 
5897: Mephistopheles
5898: 
5899: You sensual wooer, beyond the sensual,
5900: A Magdalen leads you by the nose, I see.            3535
5901: 
5902: Faust
5903: 
5904: Abortion, of the filth and fire of hell!
5905: 
5906: Mephistopheles
5907: 
5908: And how well she reads one’s physiognomy:
5909: In my presence, senses, without knowing how,
5910: The hidden mind behind the mask: she feels
5911: That I’m an evil genius, at least, and now          3540
5912: Perhaps, that it’s the Devil it conceals.
5913: So, tonight? –
5914: 
5915: Faust
5916: 
5917:          What’s that to you?
5918: 
5919: Mephistopheles
5920: 
5921: I take my pleasure in it too!
5922: Part I Scene XVII: At The Fountain
5923: 
5924: (Gretchen and Lisbeth.)
5925: 
5926: Lisbeth
5927: 
5928: Have you not heard from Barbara?
5929: 
5930: Gretchen
5931: 
5932: Not a word. I go out so seldom.                3545
5933: 
5934: Lisbeth
5935: 
5936: It’s certain, Sibyl told me: well then,
5937: She finally fell to that seducer.
5938: There’s a lady for you!
5939: 
5940: Gretchen
5941: 
5942:                        How so?
5943: 
5944: Lisbeth
5945: 
5946:                                   It stinks!
5947: She’s feeding two when she eats and drinks.
5948: 
5949: Gretchen
5950: 
5951: Oh!                                            3550
5952: 
5953: Lisbeth
5954: 
5955:       Serves her right then, finally.
5956: She clung to that fellow, oh so tightly!
5957: That was a fine to-ing and fro-ing,
5958: Round the village, and dance-going,
5959: Ahead of us all, they had to shine,            3555
5960: Him treating her always to cakes and wine:
5961: She the picture of loveliness, oh so fine,
5962: So low after all, then, and so shameless,
5963: And the gifts she took from him, nameless.
5964: It was all kissing and carrying on:             3560
5965: But now the flower is gone!
5966: 
5967: Gretchen
5968: 
5969: The poor thing!
5970: 
5971: Lisbeth
5972: 
5973:               Why are you so pitying?
5974: When each of us was at our spinning,
5975: When mother never let us out,
5976: She and her lover hung about:                   3565
5977: On the bench, in a dark alley,
5978: Forgetting the time, he and she.
5979: She can’t raise her head again,
5980: In a sinner’s shift now, penitent.
5981: 
5982: Gretchen
5983: 
5984: Surely he’ll take her for his wife.             3570
5985: 
5986: Lisbeth
5987: 
5988: He’d be a fool! A lively fellow
5989: Can ply his trade elsewhere, and so -
5990: He’s gone.
5991: 
5992: Gretchen
5993:                      Oh, that’s not nice!
5994: 
5995: Lisbeth
5996: 
5997: If she gets him, she’ll reap ill in a trice,
5998: The lads will tear at her wreath, what’s more   3575
5999: We’ll scatter chaff in front of her door!
6000: (She exits.)
6001: 
6002: Gretchen (Walking home.)
6003: 
6004: How proudly I’d revile her, then,
6005: Whenever some poor girl had fallen!
6006: I couldn’t find words enough, I mean,
6007: To pour out scorn for another’s sin!         3580
6008: Black as it seemed, I made it blacker,
6009: Not black enough for me: oh never.
6010: It blessed its own being, that proud self,
6011: Yet now I’m the image of sin, myself!
6012: Yet all that drove me on to do it,           3585
6013: God! Was so fine! Oh, so sweet!
6014: Part I Scene XVIII: A Tower
6015: 
6016: (In a niche of its wall a shrine, and image of the Mater Dolorosa, with
6017: flowers in front of it. Gretchen sets out fresh flowers. )
6018: 
6019: Gretchen
6020: 
6021: Oh bow down,
6022: Sorrowful one,
6023: Your kind face, to my affliction!
6024: 
6025: A sword in your heart,                                                    3590
6026: Where a thousand pains start,
6027: You look up, at your dead Son.
6028: 
6029: You look up to the Father,
6030: You send Him your sighs, there,
6031: For His, and for your, affliction.                                        3595
6032: 
6033: Who then can feel,
6034: How like steel,
6035: Is the pain inside my bones?
6036: What my poor heart fears for,
6037: What it quakes for, and longs for                                         3600
6038: You know, and you alone!
6039: 
6040: Wherever I go now,
6041: How sore, sore, sore now
6042: How sore my heart must be!
6043: Ah, when I’m alone here,                                                  3605
6044: I moan, moan, moan here:
6045: My heart it breaks in me.
6046: 
6047: The pots before my window!
6048: My tears bedewed them so,
6049: In the early dawn, when                                                   3610
6050: I picked the flowers below.
6051: The sun it shone so brightly,
6052: And early, in my room,
6053: Where I sat already,
6054: On my bed, in deepest gloom.                        3615
6055: 
6056: Help me! Oh, save me, from shame and destruction!
6057: Oh, bow down,
6058: Sorrowful one,
6059: Your kind face, to my affliction!
6060: Part I Scene XIX: Night
6061: 
6062: (The Street in front of Gretchen’s door.)
6063: 
6064: Valentine (A soldier, Gretchen’s brother.)
6065: 
6066: When I have sat, and heard the toasts,         3620
6067: Where everyone makes good his boasts,
6068: And comrades praised, to me, the flower
6069: Of maidenhood, and loud the hour,
6070: With brimming glass that blurred the praise,
6071: And elbows sticking out all ways,              3625
6072: I sat in my own peace secure,
6073: Listening to the boastful roar,
6074: And as I stroked my beard, I’d smile
6075: And take a full glass in my hand,
6076: Saying: ‘Each to his own, but I’ll             3630
6077: Ask if there’s any in this land,
6078: Who, to my Gretel, can compare
6079: Whose worth can ever equal hers?’
6080: Hear! Hear! Clink! Clang! Went around:
6081: Some cried out: ‘He’s quite correct,           3635
6082: She’s an ornament to all her sex.’
6083: There sat the boasters, not a sound.
6084: And now! – I could tear my hair out, bawl,
6085: And dash my head against the wall! –
6086: With jeers, they now turn up their noses:      3640
6087: Every rogue can taunt me, he supposes!
6088: Like a bankrupt debtor, when I’m sitting,
6089: A casual word can start me sweating!
6090: And though I thrash them all together,
6091: I’ve still no right to call them liars.        3645
6092: 
6093: Who goes there? What’s creeping by?
6094: If I’m not wrong, there’s two I spy.
6095: If it’s him, I’ll have him by the skin,
6096: Alive he’ll not leave the place he’s in!
6097: (Faust. Mephistopheles)
6098: 
6099: Faust
6100: 
6101: How the glow of the eternal light             3650
6102: Shines from the Sacristy window, there,
6103: On either side grows fainter, fainter,
6104: And all around draws in the night!
6105: Now it seems as dark within my heart.
6106: 
6107: Mephistopheles
6108: 
6109: And I’ve a little of the tom-cat’s art,       3655
6110: That creeps around the fire escape,
6111: Then slinks along the wall, a silent shape,
6112: I’m quite virtuous in my way,
6113: A little prone to thieve, and stray.
6114: The splendour of Walpurgis Night,             3660
6115: Already haunts all my members,
6116: It’s the day after tomorrow’s light:
6117: There, why one watches, one remembers.
6118: 
6119: Faust
6120: 
6121: Meanwhile you’ll bring that wealth to view,
6122: That I see there, glimmering, behind you?     3665
6123: 
6124: Mephistopheles
6125: 
6126: You’ll soon experience the delight
6127: Of holding this cauldron to the light.
6128: I recently had a squint inside –
6129: Where splendid silver dollars hide.
6130: 
6131: Faust
6132: 
6133: And not a jewel, or a ring,                   3670
6134: To adorn my darling girl?
6135: Mephistopheles
6136: 
6137: Among the rest I saw a thing,
6138: A sort of necklace, made of pearl.
6139: 
6140: Faust
6141: 
6142: That’s good! It’s painful to me,
6143: To take no gift for her to see.         3675
6144: 
6145: Mephistopheles
6146: 
6147: You shouldn’t find it so annoying,
6148: To get something now, for nothing.
6149: Now the sky glows, filled with stars,
6150: You’ll hear the work of a master:
6151: I’ll sing a few moralising bars,        3680
6152: All the better to seduce her.
6153: 
6154: (Sings to the zither.)
6155: 
6156: ‘Why are you here,
6157: Katrina dear,
6158: In daylight clear,
6159: At your lover’s door?                   3685
6160: No, no! Not when,
6161: It will let in,
6162: A maid, and then,
6163: Let out a maid no more!
6164: 
6165: 
6166: Take care: for once                     3690
6167: It’s over and done,
6168: And it’s all gone,
6169: Goodnight to you, poor thing!
6170: Keep love’s belief,
6171: And pleasure brief,
6172: From every thief,                       3695
6173: Unless you’ve a wedding ring.’
6174: Valentine (Approaching.)
6175: 
6176: Whom do you lure? By every element!
6177: You evil-tongued rat-catcher!
6178: To the devil, with your instrument!                3700
6179: To the devil, too, with the singer!
6180: 
6181: Mephistopheles
6182: 
6183: The zither’s broken! There’s nothing left of it.
6184: 
6185: Valentine
6186: 
6187: There’s a still a skull left I’ll need to split!
6188: 
6189: Mephistopheles (To Faust.)
6190: 
6191: Look lively, Doctor! Don’t give ground.
6192: Stand by: I’ll command this thing.                 3705
6193: Out with your fly-whisk, now.
6194: You lunge! I’m parrying.
6195: 
6196: Valentine
6197: 
6198: Parry, then!
6199: 
6200: Mephistopheles
6201: 
6202:                       And why not, indeed?
6203: 
6204: Valentine
6205: 
6206: And that!
6207: 
6208: Mephistopheles
6209: 
6210:          Ah, yes!
6211: Valentine
6212: 
6213:                 The devil opposes me!
6214: What’s this? My hand’s already maimed.               3710
6215: 
6216: Mephistopheles (To Faust.)
6217: 
6218: Thrust, home!
6219: 
6220: Valentine (Falls.)
6221: 
6222:              Ah!
6223: 
6224: Mephistopheles
6225: 
6226:                   Now, the lout is tamed!
6227: Away, we must go! Swiftly, of course,
6228: Soon the cries of murder will begin,
6229: With the police, now, I’m well in:
6230: But not so much so with the courts.                  3715
6231: 
6232: (He exits with Faust.)
6233: 
6234: Martha (At the window.)
6235: 
6236: Come here! Come here!
6237: 
6238: Gretchen (At the window.)
6239: 
6240:                                    Here’s a light!
6241: 
6242: Martha
6243: 
6244: Hear how they swear and struggle, yell and fight.
6245: 
6246: On-lookers
6247: 
6248: Here’s one dead already!
6249: Martha (Leaving the house.)
6250: 
6251: Where have the murderers gone?
6252: 
6253: Gretchen (Leaving the house.)
6254: 
6255: Who is it, lying there?
6256: 
6257: On-lookers
6258: 
6259:              Your mother’s son.         3720
6260: 
6261: Gretchen
6262: 
6263: Almighty God! What misery!
6264: 
6265: Valentine
6266: 
6267: I’m dying! That’s soon spoken,
6268: And, sooner still, it will be done.
6269: Why stand there, crying, woman?
6270: Come, hear me everyone!                 3725
6271: 
6272: (They gather round him.)
6273: 
6274: You’re still young, my Gretchen, see!
6275: And still haven’t sense enough, to be
6276: Effective in your occupation.
6277: I’ll tell you confidentially:
6278: Now that you’re a whore indeed,         3730
6279: Be one, by proclamation!
6280: 
6281: Gretchen
6282: 
6283: My brother! God! Why speak to me so?
6284: 
6285: Valentine
6286: 
6287: In this business, leave God alone!
6288: Sadly, what is done is done,
6289: And what will come: will come.               3735
6290: Begin with one, in secret, then,
6291: Soon you’ll gather other men,
6292: And, when a dozen of them have had you,
6293: All the town can have you too.
6294: When Shame herself appears,                  3740
6295: She’s first brought secretly to light,
6296: Then they draw the veil of night
6297: Over both her eyes and ears:
6298: Men would gladly kill her, I say,
6299: But they let her walk about and prosper,     3745
6300: So she goes nakedly by day,
6301: Yet isn’t any lovelier.
6302: She’s the uglier to our sight,
6303: The more it is she seeks the light.
6304: Truly I can see the day                      3750
6305: When all honest people
6306: Will turn aside from you, girl,
6307: As from a corpse with plague.
6308: Your heart’s flesh will despair,
6309: When they look you in the face,              3755
6310: You’ll have no golden chain to wear!
6311: At the altar, there, you’ll have no place!
6312: You’ll not be dancing joyfully
6313: In all your lovely finery!
6314: In some wretched gloomy corner, you          3760
6315: Will hide, with cripples and beggars too,
6316: And, though God may still forgive,
6317: Be damned on earth while you live!
6318: 
6319: Martha
6320: 
6321: Commend your soul to God’s mercy!
6322: Will you end your life with blasphemy?       3765
6323: Valentine
6324: 
6325: If I could destroy your withered body,
6326: Shameless, bawd, I’d hope to see
6327: A full measure of forgiveness
6328: For me, and all my sinfulness.
6329: 
6330: Gretchen
6331: 
6332: My brother! These are the pains of hell!   3770
6333: 
6334: Valentine
6335: 
6336: I said, leave off weeping, girl!
6337: When you and honour chose to part,
6338: That was the sword-thrust in my heart.
6339: I go, through a sleep within the grave,
6340: To God, as a soldier, true and brave.      3775

6348: 
6349: The Evil Spirit
6350: 
6351: How different it was, Gretchen,
6352: When you, still innocent,
6353: Came here to the altar,
6354: And from that well-thumbed Book,
6355: Babbled your prayers,                                               3780
6356: Half, a childish game,
6357: Half, God in your heart!
6358: Gretchen!
6359: What’s in your mind?
6360: In your heart,                                                      3785
6361: What crime?
6362: Do you pray for your mother’s soul, who
6363: Through you, fell asleep to long, long torment?
6364: Whose blood is on your doorstep?
6365: And beneath your heart,                                             3790
6366: Does not something stir and swell,
6367: And trouble you, and itself,
6368: A presence full of foreboding?
6369: 
6370: Gretchen
6371: 
6372: Oh! Oh!
6373: Would I were free of the thoughts                                   3795
6374: That rush here and there inside me,
6375: Despite myself!

6387: The trumpet sounds!
6388: The grave trembles!
6389: And your heart,
6390: From ashen rest,
6391: To fiery torment                                                     3805
6392: Brought again,
6393: Shudders!
6394: 
6395: Gretchen
6396: 
6397: Would I were not here!
6398: It seems to me as if the organ
6399: Steals my breath,                                                    3810

6455: 
6456: Mephistopheles
6457: 
6458: Don’t you just long for a broomstick?                         3835
6459: I wish I’d the sturdiest goat to ride.
6460: Like this, the journey’s not so quick.
6461: 
6462: Faust
6463: 
6464: So long as my legs can do the trick,
6465: This knotted stick will do me fine.
6466: Why do we need a shorter way! –                               3840
6467: To wander this labyrinth of valleys,
6468: Climb all these cliffs and gullies,
6469: From which the waters ever spray,
6470: That’s a delight enchants the day!
6471: Spring stirs already in the birches,                          3845
6472: And even the fir tree knows it now:
6473: Shouldn’t our limbs feel it search us?
6474: 
6475: Mephistopheles
6476: 
6477: Truly, I don’t feel a thing!
6478: It’s winter in my body, still,
6479: On my path I want it frosty, snowing.                         3850
6480: How sadly the Moon’s imperfect circle
6481: With its red belated glow, is rising,
6482: So dim its light that at every step
6483: You scrape a rock, or else a tree!
6484: Ah, there, a will o’ the wisp leapt!                          3855
6485: It’s burning fiercely, now, I see.
6486: Hey! My friend! May I ask your aid?
6487: Would you like to give us a blaze?
6488: Be so good as to light us up the hill!
6489: Will O’ The Wisp
6490: 
6491: With respect, I hope I’ll still be able,                         3860
6492: To keep my Natural light quite stable:
6493: We usually zig-zag here, at will.
6494: 
6495: Mephistopheles
6496: 
6497: Ha, ha! He thinks to play the human game.
6498: Go straight along now, in the Devil’s name!
6499: Or I’ll blow out your flickering spark!                          3865
6500: 
6501: Will O’ The Wisp
6502: 
6503: You’re master of the house, I’ll remark,
6504: And yes, I’ll serve you willingly.
6505: But think! The mount is magically mad today,
6506: And if a will o’ the wisp should lead the way,
6507: You mustn’t judge things too precisely.                          3870
6508: 
6509: Faust, Mephistopheles, The Will O’ The Wisp (In alternating song.)
6510: 
6511: We it seems, now find ourselves.
6512: In the sphere of dreams and magic,
6513: Do us honour, guide us well
6514: So our journey will be quick,
6515: Through the wide, deserted spaces!                               3875
6516: Tree on tree now shift their places,
6517: See how fast they open to us
6518: And the cliffs bow down before us,
6519: And their long and rocky noses,
6520: How they whistle and blow, for us!                               3880
6521: Through the stones, and through the grasses,
6522: Stream and streamlet, downward, hurrying.
6523: Is that rustling? Is that singing?
6524: Do I hear sweet lovers’ sighing,
6525: Heavenly days, is that their babbling?                           3885
6526: What we hope for, what we love!
6527: And the echoes, like the murmuring
6528: Of those other days, are ringing.
6529: ‘Too-wit! Too-woo!’ sounding nearer,
6530: Owl there, and jay, and plover,            3890
6531: Are they all awake above?
6532: A salamander in the scrub, he’s
6533: Long of leg, and fat of belly!
6534: And every root like a snake,
6535: Over sand and rock all bent,               3895
6536: Stretches with a strange intent,
6537: To scare us, of us prisoners make:
6538: From the gnarled and living mass,
6539: Stretching towards those who pass,
6540: Fibrous tentacles. And mice                3900
6541: Multi-coloured, lemming-wise,
6542: In the moss and in the heather!
6543: And all the fire-flies glowing,
6544: Crushed together, tightly crowding,
6545: In their tangled cohorts gather.           3905
6546: Tell me, are we standing still,
6547: Or are we climbing up the hill?
6548: All seems spinning like a mill,
6549: Rocks and trees, with angry faces
6550: Lights, now, wandering in spaces,          3910
6551: Massing: swelling at their will.
6552: 
6553: Mephistopheles
6554: 
6555: Grasp me bravely by the coat-tail!
6556: Here’s a summit in the middle,
6557: Where, astonished you can see,
6558: Mammon glowing furiously.                  3915
6559: 
6560: Faust
6561: 
6562: How strangely, through the hollow, glows
6563: A sort of dull red morning light!
6564: Into the deepest gorge it flows,
6565: Scenting abysses in their night.
6566: There vapour rises: here cloud sweeps,     3920
6567: Here the glow burns through the haze,
6568: Now like a fragile thread it creeps,
6569: Now like a coloured fountain plays.
6570: Here a vast length winds its way,
6571: In a hundred veins, down the vales,       3925
6572: And here in a corner, locked away,
6573: All at once, now lonely, fails.
6574: Nearby the sparks pour down,
6575: Like showers of golden sand,
6576: But see! On all the heights around,       3930
6577: The cliffs, now incandescent, stand.
6578: 
6579: Mephistopheles
6580: 
6581: Has Mammon not lit his palace
6582: Splendidly, for this festivity?
6583: It’s fortunate you’re here to see,
6584: I already sense the eager guests.         3935
6585: 
6586: Faust
6587: 
6588: How the wind roars through the air!
6589: And whips around my head!
6590: 
6591: Mephistopheles
6592: 
6593: Grasp the ancient stony bed,
6594: Lest you’re thrown in the abyss, there.
6595: Mist dims the night to deepest black.     3940
6596: Hear the forest timbers crack!
6597: The owls are flying off in terror.
6598: Hear, how the columns shatter,
6599: In the vast, evergreen halls.
6600: Now the boughs groan and fall!            3945
6601: All the tree-trunks are thrumming!
6602: All their roots are creaking, gaping!
6603: Sinking in a tangled horror,
6604: Crashing down on each other,
6605: And through the ruined gorges             3950
6606: The wind howls and surges.
6607: Hear the voices on the heights?
6608: Far away, and then nearby?
6609: Yes, a furious magic song
6610: Sweeps the mountain, all along!            3955
6611: 
6612: Witches (In chorus.)
6613: 
6614: To Brocken’s tip the witches stream,
6615: The stubble’s yellow, the seed is green.
6616: There the crowd of us will meet.
6617: Lord Urian has the highest seat.
6618: So they go, over stone and sticks,         3960
6619: The stinking goat, the farting witch.
6620: 
6621: A Voice
6622: 
6623: Old Baubo comes, alone, and how:
6624: She’s riding on a mother-sow.
6625: 
6626: Chorus
6627: 
6628: So honour then, where honour’s due!
6629: Baubo, goes first! Then, all the crew!     3965
6630: A tough old sow, a mother proud,
6631: Then follow, all the witches’ crowd.
6632: 
6633: A voice
6634: 
6635: Which way did you come?
6636: 
6637: A voice
6638: 
6639:                 By the Ilsen Stone!
6640: I gazed at the owl in her nest alone.
6641: What a pair of Eyes she made!              3970
6642: 
6643: A Voice
6644: 
6645: O, all you who to Hell’s gate go!
6646: Why ride there so quickly though?
6647: A Voice
6648: 
6649: She’s driven me hard: oh, see,
6650: The wounds, all over me!
6651: 
6652: Witches, Chorus
6653: 
6654: The way is broad: the way is long.
6655: Where is this mad yearning from?
6656: The fork will prick, the broom will scratch,
6657: The child will smother: the mother crack.
6658: 
6659: Wizards, Half-Chorus
6660: 
6661: Like snails in their shells, we’re crawlers,
6662: All the women are there before us.
6663: At the House of Evil, when we’re callers,      3980
6664: Woman’s a thousand steps before us.
6665: 
6666: The Other Half
6667: 
6668: We don’t measure with so much care,
6669: In a thousand steps a Woman’s there.
6670: But make whatever speed she can,
6671: A single leap, and there is Man.               3985
6672: 
6673: Voice (From above.)
6674:

6678: 
6679: We’d like to climb the heights from here.
6680: We’re as bright and clean as ever,
6681: But we’re unfruitful still, forever.
6682: Both Choruses
6683: 
6684: The wind is quiet: a star shoots by,      3990
6685: The shadowy Moon departs the sky.
6686: The magic choir’s a rush of sparks,
6687: Thousands shower through the dark.

6696: 
6697: Voice (From below.)
6698: 
6699: Take me with you! Take me with you!
6700: Climbing for three hundred years,
6701: I haven’t reached the summit yet,
6702: I long to be where my peers are met.
6703: 
6704: Both Choruses
6705: 
6706: Here’s the broom: and here’s the stick,   4000
6707: The ram is here, the fork to prick.
6708: Tonight, whoever can’t deliver
6709: There’s a man is lost forever.
6710: 
6711: Half-witches (Below.)
6712: 
6713: I’ve stumbled round so long, down here:
6714: How far ahead the rest appear!            4005
6715: I get no peace around the house,
6716: And get none either hereabouts.
6717: Chorus of Witches
6718: 
6719: An ointment makes the witches hale:
6720: A rag will do them for a sail,
6721: A trough’s a goodly ship, and tight:                 4010
6722: He’ll fly not who flies not tonight.
6723: 
6724: Both Choruses
6725: 
6726: And once we’ve soared around,
6727: So, alight then, on the ground,
6728: Cover the heather, far and wide,
6729: With your swarming witches’ tide.                    4015
6730: 
6731: (They let themselves fall.)
6732: 
6733: Mephistopheles
6734: 
6735: They push and shove, they roar and clatter!
6736: They whistle and whirl, jostle and chatter!
6737: They glimmer and sparkle, stink and flare!
6738: The genuine witch-element’s there!
6739: We’ll soon be parted, so stay near!                  4020
6740: Where are you?
6741: 
6742: Faust (In the distance.)
6743:                               Here!
6744: 
6745: Mephistopheles
6746: 
6747:             What! Nearly out of sight?
6748: Then I’ll have to use a master’s right.
6749: Ground! Sir Voland comes. Sweet folk, give ground!
6750: Here, Doctor, hold tight! In a single bound,
6751: Far from the crowd, we’ll soon be free:              4025
6752: It’s too much, even for the likes of me.
6753: Something burned there with a special light,
6754: In that thicket, as far then as I could see,
6755: Come on! We can slip inside, all right.
6756: Faust
6757: 
6758: You spirit of contradiction! Go on! I follow you.   4030
6759: I think after all it’s worked out quite cleverly:
6760: We walk the Brocken on Walpurgis Night, yet we
6761: Are as isolated now, as we ever could choose.
6762: 
6763: Mephistopheles
6764: 
6765: See now, what colours flare!
6766: A lively mob club together there.                   4035
6767: In little groups one’s not alone.
6768: 
6769: Faust
6770: 
6771: I’d still rather be higher, though!
6772: I can see fire and whirling smoke.
6773: There the crowd stream, to the Evil One:
6774: There many a puzzle finds solution.                 4040
6775: 
6776: Mephistopheles
6777: 
6778: But many a puzzle’s knotted so.
6779: Let the whole world have its riot,
6780: Here we’ll house ourselves in quiet.
6781: It’s a long and well-established tradition,
6782: From the great one makes a smaller edition.         4045
6783: I see young witches, naked, bare,
6784: And old ones, veiled cunningly.
6785: For my sake, be a little friendly.
6786: The trouble’s slight, the fun is rare.
6787: I hear instruments being tuned, too!                4050
6788: A cursed din, you’ll soon get used to.
6789: Come, with me! There’s no way otherwise,
6790: I’ll step ahead, lead you to their eyes,
6791: And earn your fresh gratitude, so.
6792: What say you? There’s lots of room, my friend.      4055
6793: Look over there! You can’t see its end.
6794: A hundred fires burning, in a row,
6795: They love, and drink, and dance, and chat,
6796: Tell me where you’ll find better than that?
6797: 
6798: Faust
6799: 
6800: Will you, as we make our bow,                     4060
6801: Play the devil, or wizard now?
6802: 
6803: Mephistopheles
6804: 
6805: To be sure I’m used to travelling incognito,
6806: But on formal occasions rank’s allowed to show.
6807: I’ve no Knight’s garter to mark me out,
6808: But the cloven foot’s honoured in this house.     4065
6809: Do you see how that snail there crawls to me:
6810: With those delicate feelers on its head,
6811: It’s already scented me, you see,
6812: I can’t deny myself, if I wished.
6813: Come! We’ll go from fire to fire,                 4070
6814: I’m the broker: you’re the suitor.
6815: 
6816: (To some, sitting by dying embers.)
6817: 
6818: Old sirs, what do you sit at the edge for?
6819: I’d praise you, in the middle, more,
6820: Among the youthful buzz, and shout.
6821: You’re alone enough inside the house.             4075
6822: 
6823: The General
6824: 
6825: Who would trust the Nation!
6826: One’s toiled so long for it:
6827: With the people, as with women,
6828: Youth’s always the best fit.
6829: 
6830: The Minister
6831: 
6832: From every rule they’ve gone astray,              4080
6833: Me, I praise the good old days,
6834: Then, truly, we were all the rage,
6835: That was a real golden age.
6836: The Nouveau Riche
6837: 
6838: We weren’t so stupid, you’d have found,
6839: And often did, what wasn’t right:               4085
6840: But now it all turns round and round,
6841: Just as we’d like to grasp it tight.
6842: 
6843: Author
6844: 
6845: Who writes anything good these days,
6846: Or reads with moderate intelligence!
6847: And what the dear young folk all praise,        4090
6848: I’ve never seen such stupid nonsense.
6849: 
6850: Mephistopheles (Suddenly looking old.)
6851: 
6852: I feel folk are ripe for Judgement Day,
6853: Of Witches’ Mount, I’ve made my last ascent.
6854: And now my cask runs cloudy, anyway,
6855: The world itself is all as good as spent.       4095
6856: 
6857: Witch-Marketeer
6858: 
6859: Gentlemen: don’t pass me by!
6860: Don’t lose the opportunity!
6861: Inspect my wares attentively,
6862: I’ve a selection for your eye.
6863: There’s nothing on my stall, here,              4100
6864: On Earth, it’s equal you’ll not find,
6865: That hasn’t caused some harm somewhere,
6866: To the world itself, and then, mankind.
6867: No knife that isn’t dyed in gore,
6868: No cup that, through some healthy body,         4105
6869: Hot, gnawing venom hasn’t poured,
6870: No gems that haven’t bought some kindly
6871: Girl, no sword that’s not cut ties that bind,
6872: Or, perhaps, struck an enemy from behind.
6873: Mephistopheles
6874: 
6875: Granny! You misunderstand the age.                   4110
6876: What’s gone: is done! What’s done: is gone!
6877: Get novelties they’re all the rage!
6878: Now it’s novelties that lead us on.
6879: 
6880: Faust
6881: 
6882: Don’t let me lose myself in here!
6883: Now, this is what I call a fair!                     4115
6884: 
6885: Mephistopheles
6886: 
6887: This whole whirlpool’s trying to climb above,
6888: You think you’re shoving, and you’re being shoved!
6889: 
6890: Faust
6891: 
6892: Who is that, there?
6893: 
6894: Mephistopheles
6895: 
6896:              Note that madam!
6897: That’s Lilith.
6898: 
6899: Faust
6900:             Who?
6901: 
6902: Mephistopheles
6903: 
6904:             First wife to Adam.
6905: Pay attention to her lovely hair,                    4120
6906: The only adornment she need wear.
6907: When she traps a young man in her snare,
6908: She won’t soon let him from her care.
6909: Faust
6910: 
6911: Those two, the old and young one, sitting,
6912: They’ve leapt about more than is fitting!      4125
6913: 
6914: Mephistopheles
6915: 
6916: No rest tonight for anyone.
6917: Let’s grasp them. There’s a new dance, come!
6918: 
6919: Faust (Dancing with the lovely young witch.)
6920: 
6921: A lovely dream once came to me,
6922: And there I saw an apple-tree,
6923: Two lovely apples, there, did shine,           4130
6924: Tempting me so, I had to climb.
6925: 
6926: The Young Witch
6927: 
6928: Apples you love a lot, I know,
6929: That once in Paradise did grow.
6930: I’m deeply moved with joy to feel,
6931: That such my garden does reveal.               4135
6932: 
6933: Mephistopheles (Dancing with the old witch.)
6934: 
6935: A vile dream once came to me,
6936: In it, I saw an old cleft tree,
6937: A monstrous crack there met my eyes,
6938: It pleased me, though, despite its size.
6939: 
6940: The Old Witch
6941: 
6942: I offer my best greetings to                   4140
6943: The knight of the cloven shoe!
6944: He’ll need to have a real stopper,
6945: If he’s not scared of that whopper.
6946: A Rationalist (Nicolai)
6947: 
6948: Cursed Folk! How do you dare to?
6949: Haven’t we shown, for many a season,                     4145
6950: Spirits can’t exist: it stands to reason?
6951: Yet you dance around, just as we do!
6952: 
6953: The Lovely Witch (Dancing.)
6954: 
6955: Why’s he here then, at our ball?
6956: 
6957: Faust (Dancing.)
6958: 
6959: Oh! He’s everywhere, and into all.
6960: While others dance, he must reflect.                     4150
6961: If he can’t discuss every last step,
6962: It’s as good as if it didn’t happen.
6963: He’s angriest at a forward pattern.
6964: But if you turn around in circles,
6965: As he does in his ancient mills,                         4155
6966: He’ll call it excellent, least ways
6967: If you greet with interest what he says.
6968: 
6969: The Rationalist
6970: 
6971: You’re still there! Oh, it’s quite unheard of.
6972: We’re enlightened now, so take yourselves off!
6973: The Devil’s crew’s discounted by every rule:             4160
6974: Yet though clever, still we’re haunted, in Tegel, too.
6975: 
6976: The Young Witch
6977: 
6978: Well listen: here we’re bored with it!
6979: 
6980: The Rationalist
6981: 
6982: I tell you, Spirit, to your face:                        4165
6983: For me, spirit-rule has no place:
6984: Because my spirit can’t exercise it.
6985: (The dance continues.)
6986: 
6987: I see, tonight, I’ll have no success:
6988: But I get a bit from every trip,
6989: And hope, before the final step,              4170
6990: I’ll defeat the devils and the poets.
6991: 
6992: Mephistopheles
6993: 
6994: Now he’ll sit in some wet sump,
6995: And console himself, like that, about you,
6996: And if he sticks leeches on his rump,
6997: He’s cured of the Spirit, and Spirits, too.   4175
6998: 
6999: (To Faust, who has left the dance.)
7000: 
7001: Why have you deserted that lovely girl,
7002: Who sang so sweetly in the dancing?
7003: 
7004: Faust
7005: 
7006: Ugh! Right in the middle of her singing
7007: A red mouse sprang out of her mouth.
7008: 
7009: Mephistopheles
7010: 
7011: That’s fine: don’t brood on it, anyway:       4180
7012: Enough, that the mouse wasn’t grey.
7013: At harvest time who queries a mouse?
7014: 
7015: Faust
7016: 
7017: Then I saw –
7018: 
7019: Mephistopheles
7020: 
7021:                     What?
7022: Faust
7023: 
7024:                 Mephisto, can you see
7025: That lovely child, far off, alone there,        4185
7026: Travelling slowly, so painfully,
7027: As if her feet were chained together.
7028: I must admit, without question
7029: She’s the image of my sweet Gretchen.
7030: 
7031: Mephistopheles
7032: 
7033: Forget all that! It benefits no one.
7034: It’s a lifeless magic form, a phantom.          4190
7035: Encountering it will do you no good:
7036: Its fixed stare freezes human blood,
7037: And then one’s almost turned to stone:
7038: Medusa’s story is surely known.
7039: 
7040: Faust
7041: 
7042: Those are the eyes of the dead, truly,          4195
7043: No loving hand has closed their void.
7044: That’s the breast Gretchen offered to me:
7045: That’s the sweet body I enjoyed.
7046: 
7047: Mephistopheles
7048: 
7049: It’s magic, fool: you’re an easy one to move!
7050: She comes to all, as if she were their love.    4200
7051: 
7052: Faust
7053: 
7054: What delight! What pain!
7055: I can’t turn from her, again.
7056: Strange, around her lovely throat,
7057: A single scarlet cord adorns her,
7058: Like a knife-cut, and no wider!                 4205
7059: Mephistopheles
7060: 
7061: That’s right! I see it too: and note,
7062: She can carry her head under her arm,
7063: Since Perseus did her that fatal harm.
7064: Always desire for that illusion!
7065: Come on, climb this bit of mountain:        4210
7066: It’s as lively as the Vienna Prater,
7067: And if no one’s deceiving me,
7068: I’m looking at a genuine theatre.
7069: You’re showing?
7070: 
7071: Servibilis
7072: 
7073:            It’ll be on again shortly.
7074: A fresh performance: last of seven.         4215
7075: That number, for us, is traditional.
7076: An amateur’s written it, and then
7077: It’s amateurs who perform it all.
7078: Forgive me, sir, if I break off here,
7079: Since I’m the amateur curtain-raiser.       4220
7080: 
7081: Mephistopheles
7082: 
7083: That I find you on the Blocksberg’s good,
7084: Since I find you exactly where I should.
7085: Part I Scene XXII: A Walpurgis Night’s Dream
7086: 
7087:                            Or
7088: 
7089:          Oberon and Titania’s Golden Wedding.
7090: 
7091:              An Interlude (Intermezzo)
7092: 
7093: Theatre Manager
7094: 
7095: You brave stagehands, of Weimar,
7096: Take a rest, at least for today.
7097: Ancient mountains, misty vales are,             4225
7098: All the scenery for our play.
7099: 
7100: Herald
7101: 
7102: Fifty years we’ve passed by,
7103: To make this wedding golden,
7104: But let some argument arise:
7105: There’s gold in it, for me, then.               4230
7106: 
7107: Oberon
7108: 
7109: Spirits, where I am, be seen:
7110: Appear, all, at this moment:
7111: Fairy King, and Fairy Queen,
7112: Renew their old intent.
7113: 
7114: Puck
7115: 
7116: Puck comes shooting through the air,            4235
7117: And moves his feet, in time:
7118: After him a hundred, there,
7119: Share his joyful rhyme.
7120: Ariel
7121: 
7122: Ariel conducts his singing
7123: In pure and heavenly tones:               4240
7124: Ugly faces greet its ringing,
7125: But also lovely ones.
7126: 
7127: Oberon
7128: 
7129: Partners if you’d get along,
7130: Learn then from the two of us!
7131: If we in pairs would love for long,       4245
7132: Someone needs to separate us.
7133: 
7134: Titania
7135: 
7136: The sulky man, the wilful wife,
7137: So they might know each other,
7138: I’d show him all the Northern ice,
7139: And show her the Equator.                 4250
7140: 
7141: The Whole Orchestra (Tutti. Very loud.)
7142: 
7143: From fly-snout and midge-nose,
7144: And all of their relations,
7145: Frog and cricket, too, there flow
7146: These musical vibrations!
7147: 
7148: Solo
7149: 
7150: See, the bagpipes on their way!           4255
7151: Made from a soap-bubble.
7152: Hear the snail’s-twaddle play
7153: Through its stumpy nozzle.
7154: Spirit (Newly formed.)
7155: 
7156: Spider’s-feet and toad’s-belly,
7157: With useless winglets to ’em!
7158: A little creature, it can’t be
7159: But it makes a little poem.
7160: 
7161: A Tiny Couple
7162: 
7163: Little steps and high leaps,
7164: Through honeydew and fragrance here,
7165: You still won’t do enough it seems,    4265
7166: To climb into the atmosphere.
7167: 
7168: A Curious Traveller
7169: 
7170: A masquerade of mockery?
7171: Do I dare to trust my eyes?
7172: Oberon, that fair divinity,
7173: Do I see him here, tonight?            4270
7174: 
7175: The Orthodox
7176: 
7177: He’s no tail, and not a claw!
7178: And yet it’s him, it’s true:
7179: Like the gods of Greece, I’m sure,
7180: He must be a devil too.
7181: 
7182: Northern Artist
7183: 
7184: What I capture here today,             4275
7185: In truth is only sketchy:
7186: Yet I prepare myself, someday
7187: For my Italian journey.
7188: Purist
7189: 
7190: Ah! My bad luck brings me here:
7191: Since I haven’t been invited!             4280
7192: Of all the witches to appear,
7193: Only two are powdered.
7194: 
7195: Young Witch
7196: 
7197: Powder like a petticoat
7198: On an old, grey witch you’ll see,
7199: While I sit naked on my goat,             4285
7200: And show a fine young body.
7201: 
7202: Married Woman
7203: 
7204: We have too much experience,
7205: To moan about you, here, then!
7206: Yet, as young and tender you are, once,
7207: So, I hope you will be, rotten.           4290
7208: 
7209: Orchestral Conductor
7210: 
7211: Fly-snout and midge-nose,
7212: Don’t swarm around the naked!
7213: Frog and cricket, too, all know
7214: Your time, and don’t mistake it!
7215: 
7216: A Wind-Vane (Swinging to one side.)
7217: 
7218: Society, as one would like it done:       4295
7219: True pure brides along the slope!
7220: And young fellows, one for one,
7221: People quite brimful of hope!
7222: The Wind-Vane (Swinging to the other side.)
7223: 
7224: And if the ground doesn’t split,
7225: And swallow everyone,                                           4300
7226: I’ll be so amazed at it,
7227: I’ll leap into hell at once.
7228: 
7229: Xenies (Barbed verses: Greek – gifts exchanged.)
7230: 
7231: As insects we appear,
7232: With little claws we’re nipping,
7233: To do Satan, our Papa,                                          4305
7234: Due honour as is fitting.
7235: 
7236: Hennings (August Von Hennings, a literary enemy.)
7237: 
7238: See them, packed in a crowd,
7239: Naïve, together, poking fun!
7240: At last, they’ll even say, aloud,
7241: Their hearts were blameless ones.                               4310
7242: 
7243: Musagete (Controller of the Muses: Greek – epithet of Apollo)
7244: 
7245: Among this witches’ crew,
7246: I’d gladly lose my way:
7247: They’re easier to manage, too
7248: Than Muses, any day.
7249: 
7250: Former ‘Genius of the Age’
7251: 
7252: One was someone, among real folk.                               4315
7253: Come on, then: I can hold my end up!
7254: Like Germany’s Parnassus, look,
7255: The Blocksberg’s summit’s broad enough.
7256: Curious Traveller (Nicolai)
7257: 
7258: Say, who’s that haughty man?
7259: He walks with such proud steps.              4320
7260: He sniffs as only a sniffer-out can.
7261: ‘He smells out Jesuits.’
7262: 
7263: A Crane (Lavater)
7264: 
7265: I like to fish among the clear
7266: And the muddy levels:
7267: So the pious man appears                     4325
7268: Mixing with the devils.
7269: 
7270: A Child of This World (Goethe himself.)
7271: 
7272: To the pious man, as I’m aware,
7273: Every place is fitting,
7274: So you build, on the Blocksberg here,
7275: Many a house of meeting.                     4330
7276: 
7277: A Dancer
7278: 
7279: Does some new choir succeed?
7280: I hear a distant drum.
7281: ‘No! It’s the booming in the reeds,
7282: Of bitterns, in unison.’
7283: 
7284: A Dancing Master
7285: 
7286: How they lift their legs, this lot!          4335
7287: As best they can, they all take flight!
7288: The cripples skip, the clumsy hop,
7289: And don’t care at all what they look like.
7290: A Fiddle-Player
7291: 
7292: The ragged mob all hate so much,
7293: They’d gladly crush the others.      4340
7294: Here the bagpipe draws them, just
7295: As Orpheus’ lyre the creatures.
7296: 
7297: The Dogmatist
7298: 
7299: I won’t declare it’s madness, now,
7300: Or show myself too critical.
7301: The devil must exist somehow,        4345
7302: Or how could we act the devil?
7303: 
7304: The Idealist
7305: 
7306: The fantasy in my mind,
7307: For once, is too despotic.
7308: Truly, if I am all, I find
7309: Today I’m idiotic!                   4350
7310: 
7311: The Realist
7312: 
7313: Here’s real pain, at hand,
7314: It annoys me so to see it:
7315: For the first time, here I stand,
7316: Unsteady, on my feet.
7317: 
7318: A Believer in the Supernatural
7319: 
7320: It’s very pleasant to be here,       4355
7321: And this crowd too has merit:
7322: Since from the devil I infer
7323: Some much more virtuous spirit.
7324: A Sceptic
7325: 
7326: These little flames a-hunting go,
7327: And think they’re near the treasure:   4360
7328: But Devil rhymes with doubtful: so
7329: My being here’s a pleasure.
7330: 
7331: Orchestral Conductor
7332: 
7333: Frog on leaf, and cricket, oh
7334: You amateur editions!
7335: Fly-snout and midge-nose,              4365
7336: Remember you’re musicians!
7337: 
7338: The Skilful
7339: 
7340: Carefree, is what they call
7341: This band of happy creatures:
7342: When we can’t go on foot at all
7343: Our head it is that features.          4370
7344: 
7345: The Maladroit
7346: 
7347: We picked up many a titbit once,
7348: But now, God orders things so,
7349: Our shoes are ragged from the dance,
7350: And we travel on naked soles.
7351: 
7352: Will-O’-The-Wisps
7353: 
7354: From the swamps we’ve come,            4375
7355: Where we first arose:
7356: In the ranks here, we, at once,
7357: As glittering gallants pose.
7358: A Shooting Star
7359: 
7360: I shoot here from the sky
7361: And star- and firelight meet.          4380
7362: Now across the grass I lie -
7363: Who’ll help me to my feet?
7364: 
7365: The Heavy-Footed
7366: 
7367: Room, round about us, room!
7368: We crush the grasses under.
7369: Spirits come, and spirits too          4385
7370: Have their bulky members.
7371: 
7372: Puck
7373: 
7374: Don’t tread so heavily,
7375: Like elephantine calves: let
7376: Puck himself, the sturdy, be,
7377: On this night, the stoutest.           4390
7378: 
7379: Ariel
7380: 
7381: Loving nature winged your backs,
7382: You spirits, one supposes,
7383: Follow, then, on my light track,
7384: To the hill of roses!
7385: 
7386: Orchestra (Quietly: pianissimo)
7387: 
7388: Trailing cloud, and misted trees,      4395
7389: Brighten with the day.
7390: Breeze in leaves, and wind in reeds,
7391: And all have flown away.
7392: Part I Scene XXIII: Gloomy Day
7393: 
7394: (A Field. Faust, Mephistopheles.)
7395: 
7396: Faust
7397: 
7398: In misery! Despair! Wandering wretchedly on the face of the earth, for ages,
7399: and now imprisoned! That kind, unfortunate creature, locked up in prison as
7400: a criminal, and lost in torment! To this! This! – Treacherous, worthless
7401: spirit, you hid it from me! – Stand there, then! Roll the devil’s eyes in your
7402: head, in anger! Stand there, and defy me with your unbearable presence!
7403: Imprisoned! In irredeemable misery! Delivered up to evil spirits, and the
7404: judgement of unfeeling men! And you’ve troubled me meanwhile with
7405: tasteless diversions, concealed her growing misery from me, and left her
7406: helpless in the face of ruin!
7407: 
7408: Mephistopheles
7409: 
7410: She is not the first.
7411: 
7412: Faust
7413: 
7414: Dog! Loathsome Monster! – Change him, infinite Spirit! Change the worm
7415: into his dog-form, in which he often liked to scamper in front of me, at
7416: night, rolling at the feet of the unsuspecting traveller, and clambering on his
7417: shoulders when he fell. Change him into his favourite likeness, so he can
7418: crawl on his belly in the sand in front of me, and I can trample him,
7419: depraved thing, under my feet! – ‘Not the first!’ – Misery! Misery! That no
7420: human spirit can grasp. That more than one being should sink into the depth
7421: of this wretchedness: that the first, writhing in its death-pangs, under the
7422: eyes of Eternal Forgiveness, did not expiate the guilt of all the others! It
7423: pierces to the marrow of my bones, the misery of this one being – and you
7424: smile calmly at the fate of thousands!
7425: 
7426: Mephistopheles
7427: 
7428: Now we’re out of our wits again, already, at the point where men’s brains
7429: are cracked. Why did you enter into partnership with us, if you can’t go
7430: through with it? Would you take wing, and yet be free of dizziness? Did we
7431: thrust ourselves on you, or you on us?
7432: Faust
7433: 
7434: Don’t gnash your greedy jaws at me! It disgusts me! – Great and glorious
7435: Spirit, you who revealed yourself to me, nobly, who know my heart and
7436: soul, why shackle me to this disgraceful companion, who feeds on injury,
7437: and at the last on ruin?
7438: 
7439: Mephistopheles
7440: 
7441: Have you finished?
7442: 
7443: Faust
7444: 
7445: Save her, or woe to you! May the weightiest curse fall on you for a thousand
7446: ages!
7447: 
7448: Mephistopheles
7449: 
7450: I can’t undo the bonds of the Avenger, nor loose his bolts. – ‘Save her!’ –
7451: Who was it dragged her to ruin? I or you?
7452: 
7453: (Faust looks around, wildly.)
7454: 
7455: Would you grasp the lightning? A good thing it has not been allowed you
7456: miserable mortals! To crush the innocent one who replies is the tyrant’s way
7457: to free oneself of an embarrassment.
7458: 
7459: Faust
7460: 
7461: Take me to her! She shall be freed!
7462: 
7463: Mephistopheles
7464: 
7465: And the danger you expose yourself to? Be aware, the guilty blood from
7466: your hands lies on the town. Avenging spirits hover over the place of death,
7467: and lie in wait for the murderer’s return.
7468: Faust
7469: 
7470: And not from yours, too? Murder, and death in this world, be on you,
7471: monster! Take me there, I say, and free her.
7472: 
7473: Mephistopheles
7474: 
7475: I’ll take you: listen to what I can do! Have I all the powers of heaven and
7476: earth? I’ll confuse the jailor’s mind: you take possession of the key, and
7477: bring her out, hand in human hand! I’ll keep watch: magic horses are ready:
7478: I’ll carry you away. That, I can do.
7479: 
7480: Faust
7481: 
7482: Away!
7483: Part I Scene XXIV: Night
7484: 
7485: (An open field. Faust and Mephistopheles flying onwards on black horses.)
7486: 
7487: Faust
7488: 
7489: What do they weave, round the Ravenstone?
7490: 
7491: Mephistopheles
7492: 
7493: I don’t know what they’re cooking and brewing.                      4400
7494: 
7495: Faust
7496: 
7497: Soaring up, diving down, bending and bowing.
7498: 
7499: Mephistopheles
7500: 
7501: A guild of witches.
7502: 
7503: Faust
7504: 
7505: They scatter, they consecrate.
7506: 
7507: Mephistopheles
7508: 
7509: Away! Away!
7510: Part I Scene XXV: A Dungeon
7511: 
7512: (Faust, with a bunch of keys and a lamp, in front of an iron door.)
7513: 
7514: A long-forgotten shudder grips me,                                    4405
7515: I’m gripped by all of Mankind’s misery,
7516: Here behind these damp walls, she
7517: Lives: and all her guilt’s illusory.
7518: Do I tremble, then, to free her!
7519: Do I dread, once more, to see her!                                    4410
7520: On! Fear adds to death’s proximity.
7521: 
7522: (He grips the lock. She sings within.)
7523: 
7524: My mother, the whore
7525: She killed me!
7526: My father, the rogue,
7527: He gnawed me!                                                         4415
7528: Little sister alone
7529: Laid out the bone
7530: In the cool of the clay:
7531: Then I was a sweet bird on the stone.
7532: Fly away! Fly away!                                                   4420
7533: 
7534: Faust (Unlocking the door.)
7535: 
7536: She doesn’t know her lover’s listening,
7537: Hears the chains, the straw’s rustling.
7538: 
7539: (He enters.)
7540: 
7541: Margaret (Hiding herself in the bed of straw.)
7542: 
7543: Woe! Woe! It comes. Bitterest Death!
7544: 
7545: Faust (Whispering)
7546: 
7547: Hush! Hush! It’s I who come, to free you.
7548: Margaret (Throwing herself down in front of him.)
7549: 
7550: Are you a man? Then pity my distress.               4425
7551: 
7552: Faust
7553: 
7554: Your cries will wake the jailors, too!
7555: 
7556: (He grasps the chains, to loose them.)
7557: 
7558: Margaret (On her knees.)
7559: 
7560: Who gives the executioner
7561: Such power over me!
7562: At midnight you’re already here.
7563: Let me live, have mercy on me!                      4430
7564: Won’t it be soon enough when dawn should come?
7565: 
7566: (She stands up.)
7567: 
7568: I’m still so young, so young!
7569: And yet I’ll die!
7570: I was lovely too, that was my
7571: Ruin. My love was near, now he’s gone:              4435
7572: The garland’s torn: the flowers are done.
7573: Don’t grip me, now, so violently!
7574: What harm have I done you? Spare me!
7575: Don’t let me beg for mercy, in vain,
7576: I’ve never seen you before today!                   4440
7577: 
7578: Faust
7579: 
7580: How shall I endure this misery, say!
7581: 
7582: Margaret
7583: 
7584: I’m wholly in your power. Oh,
7585: Let me feed my baby first.
7586: I caressed it all night, though,
7587: They told me I caused it hurt,                      4445
7588: And now they say I killed it, so,
7589: And now I’ll never be happy again.
7590: They sing songs of me! It’s wicked of folk!
7591: There’s an old story ends this way,
7592: Who told them to tell it so?                     4450
7593: 
7594: Faust (Falling on his knees.)
7595: 
7596: A lover lies at your feet,
7597: Who’ll end your painful slavery.
7598: 
7599: Margaret (Throwing herself down next to him.)
7600: 
7601: O let’s kneel, the saints will bless!
7602: See here! Under these steps,
7603: Under this sill,                                 4455
7604: Seethes Hell!
7605: The Evil One
7606: With fierce anger,
7607: Makes his groan!
7608: 
7609: Faust (Aloud)
7610: 
7611: Gretchen! Gretchen!                              4460
7612: 
7613: Margaret (Listening closely.)
7614: 
7615: The voice of my lover!
7616: 
7617: (She leaps to her feet: the chains fall away.)
7618: 
7619: Where? I heard him call me.
7620: I’m free! No one holds me.
7621: To his neck, I shall fly,
7622: On his breast, I shall lie!                      4465
7623: He called Gretchen! Stood at the sill.
7624: Among the howls and cries of Hell,
7625: Among the devil’s, scornful groans,
7626: I knew his sweet, dear tones.
7627: Faust
7628: 
7629: I’m here!
7630: 
7631: Margaret
7632: 
7633:                       Here! O, say it once again!   4470
7634: 
7635: (She embraces him.)
7636: 
7637: It’s he! It’s he! Where now is all the pain?
7638: Where now the chains, the dungeon’s misery?
7639: You’re here! You come to save me.
7640: I am saved!
7641: Already the street is there again,                  4475
7642: Where I first saw you plain,
7643: And the joyful garden,
7644: Where Martha and I waited, then.
7645: 
7646: Faust (Struggling to move.)
7647: 
7648: Come with me! Come!
7649: 
7650: Margaret (Caressing him.)
7651: 
7652:                             O stay,
7653: I’ll gladly stay, if you are with me.               4480
7654: 
7655: Faust
7656: 
7657: Away!
7658: If you don’t hurry,
7659: We’ll pay for this.
7660: 
7661: Margaret
7662: 
7663: What? You can no longer kiss?
7664: My dear, so short a time to miss me,                4485
7665: And you’ve forgotten how to kiss me?
7666: Why am I so anxious on your breast?
7667: When, once, at your words, your gaze,
7668: With a whole heaven I was blessed,
7669: And you kissed me, enough to suffocate.   4490
7670: Kiss me!
7671: I kiss you: see!
7672: 
7673: (She embraces him.)
7674: 
7675: Oh! How cold and silent,
7676: Your lips.
7677: Where has your passion                    4495
7678: Gone?
7679: Who brought me this?
7680: 
7681: (She turns away from him.)
7682: 
7683: Faust
7684: 
7685: Come! Follow me! Darling, be bold!
7686: I’ll clasp you with a thousand-fold
7687: Warmth: now follow me! I beg you!         4500
7688: 
7689: Margaret (Turning to him.)
7690: 
7691: And is it you? Is it really you?
7692: 
7693: Faust
7694: 
7695: It is! Come, with me!
7696: 
7697: Margaret
7698: 
7699:            You’ll loose the chains,
7700: And take me to your breast, again.
7701: How is it you don’t shrink from me?
7702: Do you know, friend, whom you free?       4505
7703: Faust
7704: 
7705: Come! Come! The night will soon be over.
7706: 
7707: Margaret
7708: 
7709: I’ve killed my mother,
7710: I’ve drowned my child.
7711: Was it not given to you and I?
7712: You too. - You here! I scarce believe.     4510
7713: Give me your hand! This is no dream.
7714: Your dear hand! – Ah, but it’s damp!
7715: Wipe it clean! Why do I think,
7716: It has blood on.
7717: Ah God! What have you done?                4515
7718: Put your sword away,
7719: I beg you, please!
7720: 
7721: Faust
7722: 
7723: Let past be past I say!
7724: You’re destroying me!
7725: 
7726: Margaret
7727: 
7728: No you must live on: must do.              4520
7729: I’ll describe our graves to you.
7730: You must begin them
7731: This very dawn:
7732: The best one is for my mother,
7733: Then, by her, my brother,                  4525
7734: Myself, a little further, lay,
7735: But not too far away!
7736: And the little one, at my right breast.
7737: No one else by me will lie! –
7738: Ah, to nestle at your side,                4530
7739: That was a sweet, a darling bliss!
7740: But no more will I achieve it:
7741: It’s as if I must force you to it,
7742: As if you turn aside my kiss:
7743: And yet it’s you, so good, so sweet to see!    4535
7744: 
7745: Faust
7746: 
7747: You know it is, so come with me!
7748: 
7749: Margaret
7750: 
7751: Out there?
7752: 
7753: Faust
7754: 
7755: To Freedom.
7756: 
7757: Margaret
7758: 
7759:              If the grave is there,
7760: Death waiting, then I come!
7761: From here to everlasting rest,                 4540
7762: And not a step further would
7763: You go now? O Heinrich, if I could!
7764: 
7765: Faust
7766: 
7767: You can! Just will it! The door is open!
7768: 
7769: Margaret
7770: 
7771: I dare not: there’s no hope for me then.
7772: What use is flight? They lie in wait for me.   4545
7773: To be forced to beg is a bitter existence,
7774: And cursed too with an evil conscience!
7775: To wander among strangers, bitter,
7776: And even then I’d still be captured!
7777: 
7778: Faust
7779: 
7780: I’ll stay beside you.                          4550
7781: Margaret
7782: 
7783: Quickly! Quickly!
7784: Save my poor baby!
7785: Away! Down the ridge,
7786: Now, by the brook,
7787: Over the bridge,                            4555
7788: Into the wood,
7789: Left, where the plank is,
7790: There, in the pool.
7791: Seize it now: you!
7792: It’s trying to rise,                        4560
7793: It’s moving still!
7794: Save it! Save it!
7795: 
7796: Faust
7797: 
7798: Be sensible!
7799: Only one step, and then you’re free!
7800: 
7801: Margaret
7802: 
7803: If we were on the mountain, only!           4565
7804: There my mother sits, on a stone,
7805: And oh, the cold, it grips me!
7806: There my mother sits on a stone,
7807: And wags her head, so heavy.
7808: No sign, no nod, for me, I’m sure           4570
7809: Her sleep’s so long: she’ll wake no more.
7810: She slept, while we took our pleasure.
7811: That was such a time to treasure!
7812: 
7813: Faust
7814: 
7815: Here all’s useless, speech or prayer:
7816: I’ll take you from this place: I’ll dare.   4575
7817: 
7818: Margaret
7819: 
7820: Let me alone! No, no force!
7821: Don’t grip me so murderously, oh,
7822: I’ve done all else to please you so.
7823: 
7824: Faust
7825: 
7826: The day breaks! Dearest! Dearest!
7827: 
7828: Margaret
7829: 
7830: Day! Yes, it’s dawn! The last I’ll see:                     4580
7831: My wedding day, that was to be!
7832: Tell no one you’ve been with Gretchen. Ah, bright glance!
7833: It’s done with: all in vain!
7834: We two will meet again:                                     4585
7835: But not in the dance.
7836: The crowd gather, without speech.
7837: The streets, the square,
7838: Can’t hold them, there.
7839: The bell tolls, the wand breaks.                            4590
7840: Now, they seize and tie me!
7841: I’m dragged already to the block.
7842: The blade that quivers over me,
7843: Has quivered before over every neck.
7844: Silent the world, now, as the grave!                        4595
7845: 
7846: Faust
7847: 
7848: Oh, would that I’d never seen the light!
7849: 
7850: Mephistopheles (Appears outside.)
7851: 
7852: Away! Or you’ll be lost, tonight.
7853: Useless staying and praying! Chattering!
7854: The horses are shivering,
7855: The dawn breaks, clear.                                     4600
7856: Margaret
7857: 
7858: What rises in the doorway, here?
7859: Him! Him! Send him away!
7860: Why is he here in this holy place?
7861: He wants me!
7862: 
7863: Faust
7864: 
7865:                              You will live!
7866: 
7867: Margaret
7868: 
7869: God of Judgement! To you, myself I give!       4605
7870: 
7871: Mephistopheles (To Faust)
7872: 
7873: Come! Now! Or I leave you both to stew.
7874: 
7875: Margaret
7876: 
7877: Father, save me! I belong to you!
7878: Angels! In Holy Company,
7879: Draw round me: guard me!
7880: Heinrich! For you, I fear.                     4610
7881: 
7882: Mephistopheles
7883: 
7884: She is judged!
7885: 
7886: A Voice (From above.)
7887: 
7888:             She is saved!
7889: 
7890: Mephistopheles (To Faust.)
7891: 
7892:                                 To me, here!
7893: 
7894: (He vanishes, with Faust.)
7895: A Voice (From within, dying away.)
7896: 
7897: Heinrich! Heinrich!
7898: Part II Act I Scene I: A Pleasant Landscape
7899: 
7900: (Faust is lying on flowery turf, tired and restless, trying to sleep. A circle of
7901: tiny, graceful spirits hovers round him.)
7902: 
7903: Ariel (Chanting, accompanied by Aeolian Harps.)
7904: 
7905: When the springtime blossoms, falling,
7906: Shower down, and cover all things,
7907: When the fields with greener blessing                                      4615
7908: Dazzle all the world of earthlings,
7909: Little elves, but great in spirit,
7910: Haste to help, where help they can,
7911: And, be he holy, be he wicked,
7912: Pity they the luckless man.                                                4620
7913: 
7914: You, hovering in airy circles, round his head
7915: Show yourselves in proud elf-form, instead,
7916: Calm all the fierce resistance of his heart,
7917: Remove the bitter barbs of sharp remorse,
7918: Free him from past terrors, by your art.                                   4625
7919: Four are the watches night makes in its course,
7920: At once, now, mercifully, let the dark depart.
7921: Let his head sink down on pillow’s coolness,
7922: Next sprinkle him with dew from Lethe’s stream:
7923: Then let his joints be free of cramps and stiffness,                       4630
7924: So that he’s strong enough to greet day’s gleam:
7925: Elves exert your sweetest right,
7926: Return him to the holy light!
7927: 
7928: Choir (Singly, and two or more, alternately and together.)
7929: 
7930: When the balmy breezes smother
7931: All the green-encircled land,                                              4635
7932: Sweetly fragrant and mist-covered,
7933: Twilight gathers all around.
7934: Sweet peace then whispers softly,
7935: Rocks the heart on childhood’s shores,
7936: And on the eyelids, tired and weary,
7937: Closes daylight’s golden doors.
7938: Here the night’s already passing,
7939: Sacred stars set, star by star,
7940: Great lights, and the lesser glittering,
7941: Sparkling near, and gleaming far:           4645
7942: Sparkling, where the lake reflects her,
7943: Gleaming bright in cloudless height,
7944: Protecting the deep bliss of rest, there,
7945: Moon, in splendour, rules the night.
7946: 
7947: The hours have vanished now, already        4650
7948: Joy and pain have flown away,
7949: You are whole! Recover, wholly:
7950: Trust the sight of breaking day.
7951: Greening valleys, swelling hills there,
7952: Rise from out their shadowy sleep:          4655
7953: And, drifting in its waves of silver,
7954: On to harvest, flows the wheat.
7955: 
7956: Wish then, to achieve your wishes,
7957: Gaze up, at the brightness there!
7958: You are lightly tangled: this is            4660
7959: Sleep, a shell, so now emerge!
7960: Don’t delay, walk bravely, tall,
7961: When the crowd waits, hesitating:
7962: The noblest man achieves his all,
7963: By seeing, and then, swiftly, taking.       4665
7964: 
7965: 
7966: Ariel
7967: 
7968: Listen! Hear the hour nearing!
7969: Ringing out to spirit-hearing,
7970: Now, the new day is appearing.
7971: Doors of stone creak and chatter,
7972: Phoebus’ wheels roll and clatter,           4670
7973: What a din the daylight’s bringing!
7974: Trombone- and trumpeting,
7975: Eyes amazed, and ears ringing,
7976: The Unheard drops out of hearing.
7977: Slip into the flowers presence,                       4675
7978: Deeper, deeper, lie there silent,
7979: In the pebbles, where the leaves bend:
7980: If it strikes you, you’ll be deafened.
7981: 
7982: Faust
7983: 
7984: Life’s pulses beating now, with new existence,
7985: Greet the mild ethereal half-light round me:          4680
7986: You, Earth, stood firm tonight, as well: I sense
7987: Your breath is quickening all the things about me,
7988: Already, with that joy you give, beginning
7989: To stir the strengthening resolution in me,
7990: That strives, forever, towards highest Being. –       4685
7991: Now the world unfolds, in half-light’s gleam,
7992: The wood’s alive, its thousand harmonies singing,
7993: While through the valleys, misted ribbons stream:
7994: And heavenly light now penetrates the deep:
7995: Twigs, branches shoot, with fresher life it seems,    4690
7996: From fragrant gulfs, where they were sunk in sleep:
7997: Colour on colour lifts now from the ground,
7998: As leaf and flower with trembling dewdrops weep –
7999: And a paradise reveals itself, all round.
8000: Gaze upwards! – The vast mountain heights             4695
8001: Already with the solemn hour resound:
8002: They are the first to enjoy the eternal light
8003: That later, for us, will work its way below.
8004: Now, to the sloping Alpine meadows bright,
8005: It gives a fresh clarity, a newer glow,               4700
8006: And step by step it reaches us down here: –
8007: It blazes out! – Ah, already blinded, though
8008: I turn away, my eyesight wounded, pierced.
8009: So it is, when to the thing we yearn for
8010: The highest wish so intimately rehearsed,             4705
8011: We find fulfilment opening wide the door:
8012: And then, from eternal space, there breaks
8013: A flood of flame, we stand amazed before:
8014: We wished to set the torch of life ablaze,
8015: A sea of fire consumes us, and such fire!             4710
8016: Love, is it, then? Or hate? This fierce embrace,
8017: The joy and pain of alternating pyres,
8018: So that, gazing back to earth again,
8019: We seek to veil ourselves in youth’s desire.
8020: Let the sun shine on, behind me, then!               4715
8021: The waterfall that splits the cliffs’ broad edge,
8022: I gaze at with a growing pleasure, when
8023: A thousand torrents plunge from ledge to ledge,
8024: And still a thousand more pour down that stair,
8025: Spraying the bright foam skywards from their beds.   4720
8026: And in lone splendour, through the tumult there,
8027: The rainbow’s arch of colour, bending brightly,
8028: Is clearly marked, and then dissolved in air,
8029: Around it the cool showers, falling lightly.
8030: There the efforts of mankind they mirror.            4725
8031: Reflect on it, you’ll understand precisely:
8032: We live our life amongst refracted colour.
8033: Part II Act I Scene II: The Emperor’s Castle: The Throne Room
8034: 
8035: (A council of state waits for the Emperor. Trumpets.)
8036: 
8037: (Enter court attendants of all kinds, splendidly dressed. The Emperor
8038: approaches the throne: the Astrologer is to his right.)
8039: 
8040: The Emperor
8041: 
8042: I greet you all, the loved, and true,
8043: Gathered here from far and wide: -
8044: I see a wise man’s at my side,                                          4730
8045: But where on earth’s the fool?
8046: 
8047: Attendant
8048: 
8049: Right behind your mantle there,
8050: He suddenly tumbled on the stair,
8051: They dragged away the pile of fat.
8052: Dead: or drunk? No man knows that.                                      4735
8053: 
8054: A Second Attendant
8055: 
8056: At once, and at a wondrous pace,
8057: Another came to take his place.
8058: Quite extravagantly dressed,
8059: Yet troubling, since he’s so grotesque:
8060: Guards closed the door in his face,                                     4740
8061: Their halberds held crosswise too –
8062: Yet here he comes, the daring fool!
8063: 
8064: Mephistopheles (Kneeling in front of the throne.)
8065: 
8066: What is cursed, and yet is welcomed?
8067: What’s desired, yet chased away?
8068: What’s always carefully defended?                                       4745
8069: What’s abused: condemned, I say?
8070: What do you not dare appeal to?
8071: What will all, happily, hear named?
8072: What stands on the step before you?
8073: What’s banished from here, all the same?                 4750
8074: 
8075: The Emperor
8076: 
8077: For once, at least, spare us your babble!
8078: This is no time or place for riddles,
8079: They’re a matter for these gentlemen. –
8080: Solve it! I’ll gladly hear it all again.
8081: I fear my old fool’s wandered far in space:              4755
8082: Come to my side, here, and take his place.
8083: 
8084: (Mephistopheles places himself on the Emperor’s left.)
8085: 
8086: Murmurs From the Crowd
8087: 
8088: A newer fool – for newer cares –
8089: Where’s he from? – How’d he get there? –
8090: The old one fell – He’s all done in –
8091: He was fat – Now this one’s thin –                       4760
8092: The Emperor
8093: 
8094: So now, my faithful and beloved,
8095: Welcome here from near and far!
8096: We meet beneath a lucky star,
8097: Since health and luck are written above.
8098: But tell me, why in days like these,                     4765
8099: When we’ve conquered care,
8100: And carnival masks are all our wear,
8101: And delightful things are waiting,
8102: We trouble ourselves with debating?
8103: Yet since you say we have to do it,                      4770
8104: It’s settled then, and we’ll go to it.
8105: 
8106: The Chancellor
8107: 
8108: The highest virtue, like a sacred halo
8109: Circles the Emperor’s head: and so
8110: He alone may validly exercise it:
8111: Justice! – All men love and prize it,                    4775
8112: What all ask, yet wish they could do without,
8113: The people look to him to hand it out.
8114: But ah! What help can human wit deliver,
8115: Or kindly heart, or willing hand, if fever
8116: Rages wildly through the state, and evil          4780
8117: Itself is broodingly preparing evil?
8118: Look about, from this height’s extreme,
8119: Across the realm: it seems like some bad dream,
8120: Where one deformity acts on another,
8121: Where lawlessness by law is furthered,            4785
8122: And an age of crime is discovered.
8123: Here one steals cattle, there, a wife,
8124: Cross, cup and candlestick, from the altar,
8125: And boasts of it for many a year,
8126: His skin’s intact, and so’s his life.             4790
8127: Then they take their claims to court
8128: The judge, in pomp, on his high cushion,
8129: Meanwhile there grows a furious roar,
8130: From swelling tides of revolution.
8131: They insist it’s crime and disgrace,              4795
8132: With their accomplices beside them,
8133: And ‘Guilty!’ is the verdict in a case,
8134: Only where Innocence is its own defence.
8135: So all the world will slash and chop,
8136: Destroying just what suits themselves:            4800
8137: How then can that true sense develop
8138: That shows the morally acceptable?
8139: At last the well-intentioned man
8140: Yields to the bribe, the flatterer:
8141: And the judge who can’t convict, is hand          4805
8142: In hand with the criminal offender.
8143: I’ve painted in black, but I’d rather draw
8144: Its image in the deeper colour that I saw.
8145: 
8146: (Pause)
8147: 
8148: The conclusion’s inescapable:
8149: If all men suffer when all cause trouble,         4810
8150: Then His Majesty himself is harmed.
8151: The Commander in Chief
8152: 
8153: How riotous things are in this wild age!
8154: They all lash out, and are lashed, these days,
8155: And everyone is deaf to all command.
8156: The citizen behind his wall,                            4815
8157: The knight in his cliff-top tower,
8158: Have sworn to defy us all,
8159: And hold fast to their power.
8160: The impatient mercenaries
8161: Impetuously demand their pay,                           4820
8162: And if we owed them less, already
8163: They’d be off, and march away.
8164: If one forbids what all desire,
8165: He’s disturbed a hornet’s nest:
8166: The kingdom, they should keep entire,                   4825
8167: Is plundered, and distressed.
8168: They’d like to wreak a wild disorder,
8169: Half the world has been dissolved:
8170: There are still kings beyond our border,
8171: But none of them think they’re involved.                4830
8172: 
8173: The Treasurer
8174: 
8175: In allies, then, who’d put their trust!
8176: The subsidies they promised us,
8177: Like water pipes are all blocked up.
8178: And, Sire, in all your wide estate,
8179: Who’s benefited from the take?                   4835
8180: Wherever you go, there’s some new pup,
8181: Who declares his independence.
8182: We watch, while they carry on:
8183: We’ve given away our rights, and hence,
8184: No rights are left for us, not one.                     4840
8185: Our parties too, however called,
8186: Can’t be depended on today:
8187: They like to praise, and blame: it’s all
8188: Impartial both their love and hate.
8189: They’re resting: they take cover,
8190: The Ghibelline, and Guelph.                             4845
8191: Now, who’ll help his neighbour?
8192: Each man just helps himself.
8193: The golden doors are fastened tight,
8194: Men scrape and scratch and glean, all right,         4850
8195: But our coffers still are empty.
8196: 
8197: The Steward
8198: 
8199: What evils, too, I must endure!
8200: We try to save each day, I’m sure,
8201: But every day sees greater need:                     4855
8202: So, daily, some new torment’s mine.
8203: The cooks, alas, have all they want:
8204: Boar, pheasant, hare and venison,
8205: Ducks and peacocks, chickens, geese,
8206: Payment in kind, and guaranteed,
8207: They keep coming all the time,                       4860
8208: But in the end we’re short of wine.
8209: Though cask on cask once filled the cellar,
8210: The best of vintages, and names, there,
8211: These noble lords can drink forever,
8212: And haven’t left a single drop.                      4865
8213: The council too must have their fill,
8214: They grasp their tankards tight until,
8215: Under the table, they have to stop.
8216: Now I’ll count the cost, you’ll see,
8217: The moneylenders won’t spare me,                     4870
8218: The advances that they give gladly,
8219: Will eat the future years, on top.
8220: Pigs don’t have time to fatten: instead
8221: Men seize the pillows from your bed,
8222: Even the bread from your table’s gone.               4875
8223: 
8224: The Emperor (After reflection, to Mephistopheles.)
8225: 
8226: Fool, do you know anything else that’s wrong?
8227: Mephistopheles
8228: 
8229: Me? Nothing at all! I see splendour, as I must,
8230: Around me, of you and yours! – Lack trust,
8231: Where Majesty commands so, without question,
8232: Where ready force scatters the enemy faction?               4880
8233: Where strong wills, with wit to understand,
8234: Active and various, are all at hand?
8235: What, for some evil purpose, could combine,
8236: For darkness, then, where such stars shine?
8237: 
8238: Murmurs
8239: 
8240: Here’s a rogue – who understands –                          4885
8241: He’ll tell lies – as long as he can –
8242: I wonder too – what lies behind –
8243: And what’s in front? – A project of some kind –
8244: 
8245: Mephistopheles
8246: 
8247: In this world, what isn’t lacking, somewhere, though?
8248: Sometimes it’s this, or that: here what’s missing’s gold.   4890
8249: True you can’t just rake it up from the floor,
8250: But wisdom knows the mines where one gets more.
8251: In mountain veins, foundation walls,
8252: Coined and un-coined golden hoards,
8253: And ask me, now, who’ll bring it to the light:              4895
8254: One gifted with Mind’s power and Nature’s might.
8255: 
8256: The Chancellor
8257: 
8258: Mind and Nature – don’t speak to Christians so.
8259: That’s why men burn atheists, below,
8260: Such speech is dangerous, all right,
8261: Nature is sin, and Mind’s the devil,                        4900
8262: It harbours within it, Doubt, that evil,
8263: Their misshapen hermaphrodite.
8264: Not so with us! – In the Emperor’s land
8265: Two kinds of men are still at hand
8266: Worthy alone to defend the throne:                          4905
8267: The Saints are they, and the Knights:
8268: They enter life’s uncertain fights,
8269: Rewards of Church and State they own:
8270: Firm in their resistance, check
8271: The confused aims of everyman.                        4910
8272: No, Nature and Mind are heretics!
8273: Wizards! Ruining town and land.
8274: And you, with brazen impudence still
8275: Invoke them here in this high circle:
8276: You’re fostering the corrupted will,                  4915
8277: Fools are always hand in hand.
8278: 
8279: Mephistopheles
8280: 
8281: By this I recognise a most learned lord!
8282: What you can’t feel lies miles abroad,
8283: What you can’t grasp, you think, is done with too.
8284: What you don’t count on can’t be true,                4920
8285: What you can’t weigh won’t weigh, of old,
8286: What you don’t coin: that can’t be gold.
8287: 
8288: The Emperor
8289: 
8290: You won’t sort out our faults like that,
8291: Will Lenten sermons make men fat?
8292: I’m tired of the eternal ‘if and when’:               4925
8293: We’re short of gold, well fine, so fetch some then.
8294: 
8295: Mephistopheles
8296: 
8297: I’ll fetch what you wish, and I’ll fetch more:
8298: Easy it’s true, but then easy things weigh more:
8299: It’s there already, yet how we might achieve it,
8300: That’s the tricky thing, knowing how to seize it.     4930
8301: Just think how, in those times of consternation,
8302: When a human flood drowned land and nation,
8303: People were so terrified, everywhere,
8304: They hid their treasures, here and there.
8305: So it was when mighty Rome held sway,                 4935
8306: And so it goes on, yesterday and today.
8307: Still buried in the earth, why, there it is:
8308: The earth is the Emperor’s, so it’s his.
8309: 
8310: The Treasurer
8311: 
8312: For a Fool his aim’s not out of sight:
8313: It’s true, that’s an old Imperial right.                4940
8314: 
8315: The Chancellor
8316: 
8317: Satan lays out his gilded nets, for you,
8318: These things don’t square with what’s good and true.
8319: 
8320: The Steward
8321: 
8322: Only bring them to court: I’ll welcome the sight,
8323: And I’ll gladly accept the thing as not quite right.
8324: 
8325: The Commander in Chief
8326: 
8327: The Fool’s clever, to promise what each of us needs:    4945
8328: A soldier will never ask from whence it all proceeds.
8329: 
8330: Mephistopheles
8331: 
8332: If you think I’m cheating you, maybe,
8333: Why here’s the man: ask Astrology!
8334: He knows each circling hour and house:
8335: So ask him: how are the Heavens now?                    4950
8336: 
8337: Murmurs
8338: 
8339: Two rogues, there – already known –
8340: Fool and Dreamer – so near the throne –
8341: An idle song – an ancient rhyme –
8342: The Fool plays – the Wise Man speaks, in time –
8343: The Astrologer (Speaks, with Mephistopheles prompting him.)
8344: 
8345: The Sun, himself, he is of purest gold:                       4955
8346: Mercury, messenger, of riches told:
8347: Venus has bewitched you all, and she
8348: Looks on you, soon and late, quite lovingly:
8349: The chaste Moon’s mood holds fast:
8350: Mars won’t harm: his strength won’t last:                     4960
8351: And Jupiter remains the loveliest sight:
8352: While Saturn’s great, but far away and slight.
8353: His metal we don’t greatly venerate,
8354: Light of worth, though leaden in its weight.
8355: Yes! When Sun and Moon are conjoined fine,                    4965
8356: Silver and gold will make the whole world shine:
8357: The rest as well in turn are all achieved,
8358: Palaces, gardens proud, and rosy cheeks:
8359: All this he brings this highly knowledgeable man:
8360: He can deliver, too, what nobody else here can.               4970
8361: 
8362: The Emperor
8363: 
8364: The words they say, I hear them twice,
8365: And yet I’m not convinced they’re right.
8366: 
8367: Murmurs
8368: 
8369: What’s all that? - A joke gone flat –
8370: Horoscopy – And Chemistry –
8371: I’ve heard that vein – Hoped in vain –                        4975
8372: Come, quick – It’s still a trick –
8373: 
8374: Mephistopheles
8375: 
8376: They stand around: they’re all amazed,
8377: They don’t trust what can be found,
8378: One babbles about deadly nightshade,
8379: The other of some jet-black hound.                            4980
8380: What matter if one thinks I’m jesting,
8381: Or another calls it sorcery,
8382: If the soles of their feet are itching,
8383: If their firm step totters towards me.
8384: All can feel the secret working                4985
8385: Of Nature’s everlasting power,
8386: And from its deepest lurking,
8387: A living vein shall rise and flower.
8388: When every member twitches,
8389: When all looks strange to your eyes,           4990
8390: Make up your minds, be delvers,
8391: Here the players, there the prize!
8392: 
8393: Murmurs
8394: 
8395: It’s like a lead-weight on my feet –
8396: My arm’s swollen – but then, it’s gouty –
8397: There’s a tickle here in my big toe –          4995
8398: All the way down my back it goes –
8399: From these signs, I’d say we’re near
8400: A rich vein of treasure, here.
8401: 
8402: The Emperor
8403: 
8404: Quick then! Don’t slope off there!
8405: Let’s test your froth of lies,                 5000
8406: Show us, all, this rarest prize.
8407: I’ll lay down the sword and sceptre,
8408: With my own noble hands, as well,
8409: If you don’t lie, complete the work myself,
8410: And, if you lie, then send you down to Hell!   5005
8411: 
8412: Mephistopheles
8413: 
8414: I’ll find the way there anyway –
8415: Yet I really can’t exaggerate
8416: What’s lying round ownerless, everywhere.
8417: The farmer, ploughing the furrows, lays bare
8418: A crock of gold the clods unfold:              5010
8419: Seeks saltpetre from damp limy walls,
8420: And finds there golden rolls of gold,
8421: In his poor hands: frightened by all.
8422: What caverns exist to be blown open,
8423: Through what shafts and cuttings then,            5015
8424: Burrow those gold-divining men,
8425: Those neighbours of the Underworld!
8426: Secure in vast ancient cellars, find,
8427: Golden plates, bowls, cups for wine,
8428: In rows, and heaps where they were hurled:        5020
8429: Goblets fashioned out of rubies,
8430: And if they wants to try their uses,
8431: Beside them there’s the ancient fluid.
8432: Yet – I would trust the expert though –
8433: The wooden casks rotted long ago,                 5025
8434: The wine makes tartar, in the liquid.
8435: Not just gold, and jewels, fine
8436: But the essence then of noble wine
8437: Terror hides, and night, as stark.
8438: So quiz the wise untiringly:                      5030
8439: It’s trivial, by day, to see:
8440: Mystery: houses in the dark.
8441: 
8442: The Emperor
8443: 
8444: See to it then! What use is it out of sight?
8445: Whatever’s valuable must see the light.
8446: Who knows a rogue for certain but by day?         5035
8447: At night all cows are black, and cats are grey.
8448: The pots down there, full of golden weight –
8449: Drive your plough, and, ploughing, excavate.
8450: 
8451: Mephistopheles
8452: 
8453: Take hoe and spade: and dig yourself,
8454: Labouring will make you great,                    5040
8455: A herd of golden calves, you’ll help
8456: To rise from out their buried state.
8457: Then with delight, without delay,
8458: You can, yourself, your love array:
8459: Glittering colours, shining gems, will best       5045
8460: Enhance your majesty, and her loveliness.
8461: The Emperor
8462: 
8463: Quick then, quick! How slow it always is!
8464: 
8465: The Astrologer (Prompted by Mephistopheles.)
8466: 
8467: Sire, restrain your urgent passion, please.
8468: First let all your pleasant pastimes go:
8469: Distracted natures won’t achieve the goal.            5050
8470: First we must atone for them in quiet,
8471: Lower things are gained by the higher.
8472: Who wants the good, must first be good:
8473: Who wants delight, must calm the blood:
8474: Who longs for wine, treads ripened grapes:            5055
8475: Who hopes for miracles, strengthens then his faith.
8476: 
8477: The Emperor
8478: 
8479: So let the time be passed in merriment!
8480: Ash Wednesday will achieve our grave intent.
8481: And we can celebrate, wild Carnival,
8482: More riotously, meanwhile, after all.                 5060
8483: 
8484: (They exit to the sound of trumpets.)
8485: 
8486: Mephistopheles
8487: 
8488: How merit and luck are linked together
8489: These fools can’t see, no, not a one:
8490: If they’d the Philosopher’s Stone, as ever,
8491: There’d lack a philosopher for the stone.
8492: Part II Act I Scene III: A Spacious Hall with Adjoining Rooms
8493: 
8494: (Arranged and decorated for a Carnival Masque.)
8495: 
8496: Herald
8497: 
8498: In our German lands, fear no evil,                              5065
8499: Dance of Death or Fool, or Devil:
8500: There’s a cheerful feast, here: wait.
8501: Our Sire, on his Roman travels,
8502: Has, for his profit, and our revels,
8503: Crossed the highest Alpine levels,                              5070
8504: And gained himself a happier State.
8505: The Emperor kissed the holy slipper,
8506: First, won sovereign rights, and as,
8507: He was gifted with the crown, there,
8508: Accepted a fool’s cap, for us.                                  5075
8509: We’re all newly born, now:
8510: Every sophisticated man,
8511: Pulls it snug over ears and brow:
8512: He seems a poor fool, but he’ll vow
8513: To wear it wisely as he can.                                    5080
8514: I see they’re gathering already,
8515: Hesitant alone, or paired off intimately:
8516: Chorus on chorus pushing through.
8517: In, and out, quite undeterred:
8518: And end up where they were before, too.                         5085
8519: With its hundred thousand scenes of the absurd,
8520: The World itself is just one giant Fool.
8521: Flower Girls (Singing, accompanied by mandolins.)
8522: 
8523: Dressed to win your praises,
8524: We are here tonight,
8525: Young Florentine ladies,                                   5090
8526: At the German Court of light.
8527: 
8528: Many a bright flower we wear
8529: To adorn our tawny hair:
8530: Silken threads, silken gear,
8531: They play their own part here.                             5095
8532: 
8533: Then our position’s well deserved, oh,
8534: Worth your praise, without a doubt,
8535: Our shining-flowers, by hand we sew,
8536: So they bloom year in, year out.
8537: 
8538: All kinds of coloured snippets,                            5100
8539: Placed with perfect symmetry:
8540: You might mock us bit by bit, yes,
8541: But the whole attracts you see.
8542: 
8543: We are pretty things to look on,
8544: Flower Girls, and very smart:                       5105
8545: Then, the temperament of Woman
8546: Is so very close to Art.
8547: Herald
8548: 
8549: Let’s see those trays of flowers
8550: That you carry on your heads,
8551: That paint your arms with colours:   5110
8552: What each likes, let her select.
8553: Quick: in walks and branches
8554: What a garden we will share!
8555: They are fit to crowd around us,
8556: Flower sellers and their wares.      5115
8557: 
8558: The Flower Girls
8559: 
8560: Haggle in this cheerful place,
8561: But seek no market here!
8562: At a quick and witty pace,
8563: Let all know what you bear.
8564: 
8565: An Olive-Branch with Olives
8566: 
8567: I don’t envy flowery ones,           5120
8568: Every kind of strife I shun:
8569: It’s unnatural, to me:
8570: So I am the sign of nations,
8571: And I seal their obligations,
8572: Mark of peace in any field.          5125
8573: I hope I’m worth good luck today:
8574: Some lovely head I might array.
8575: 
8576: A Garland of Wheat-Ears (Golden)
8577: 
8578: Ceres gift, for you to wear,
8579: Charming, sweet, we were all sent:
8580: The most desired of uses, here       5130
8581: As your beautiful adornment.
8582: A Fancy Garland
8583: 
8584: Like a mallow, bright with colour,
8585: A marvellous flower grew from the moss!
8586: Never known before to Nature,
8587: Yet Fashion brought it us.                                           5135
8588: 
8589: A Fancy Bouquet
8590: 
8591: My name’s for you to know,
8592: Theophrastus couldn’t tell you though:
8593: Yet I hope, if not all do,
8594: Many of us will still please you,
8595: She, I’d like, most to possess us,                                   5140
8596: Who might twine us in her tresses:
8597: Or if she should so decide,
8598: Set beside her heart, I’d ride.
8599: 
8600: Rosebuds
8601: 
8602: Many-coloured fancies may
8603: Form the fashion of the day,                                         5145
8604: Strange and curious of shape,
8605: Such as Nature never made:
8606: Stalks of green and bells of gold,
8607: Show in tresses all untold! –
8608: Yet we – remain here, covered up:                                    5150
8609: Lucky those who first discover us.
8610: When the summer is proclaimed,
8611: Then the rosebuds are in flame,
8612: Who would do without such pleasures?
8613: Promises, and yielded treasures,                                     5155
8614: That, in the flowery kingdom, rule,
8615: Mind and heart and glances, too.
8616: 
8617: (The Flower Girls garland themselves, and show their wares, gracefully, in
8618: the green leafy arcades.)
8619: The Gardeners (Singing, accompanied by lutes.)
8620: 
8621: See the flowers quietly growing,
8622: On your brows, sweetly amuse you,
8623: And their fruit will not seduce you,                                   5160
8624: One may taste delight in knowing.
8625: 
8626: Sunburned faces offer up,
8627: Peaches, plums, and cherries, yet.
8628: Buy! Against the tongue and palate,
8629: The eye is the worst way to judge.                                     5165
8630: 
8631: Come, of all this ripest fruit,
8632: Eat with taste, and delight!
8633: Poems on roses might still suit,
8634: But on the apple man must bite.
8635: 
8636: So then let us join with their                                         5170
8637: Flowering youth itself,
8638: And we’ll dress our riper wares
8639: In our neighbour’s wealth.
8640: 
8641: Dressed in cheerful garlands, there,
8642: Along this jewelled leafy route,                                       5175
8643: All things can be found together,
8644: Buds and leaves, and flowers and fruit.
8645: 
8646: (Both choruses set out their goods on the flight of steps, with alternating
8647: song accompanied by the lutes and mandolins, and offer their wares to the
8648: spectators.)
8649: A Mother (With her daughter.)
8650: 
8651: Child, when you came to light,
8652: I dressed you in your little hat:
8653: Your face was so sweet and bright,                                    5180
8654: And your body was soft, at that.
8655: I thought you’d soon be a bride,
8656: To the wealthiest of men allied,
8657: I thought you’d find a match.
8658: 
8659: Ah! Now already many a year                                           5185
8660: Has flown by, uselessly,
8661: The motley crowd of suitors here,
8662: Pass you quickly by, I see:
8663: With him you danced a lively dance,
8664: Gave that other a knowing glance                                      5190
8665: With your elbow, sharply.
8666: 
8667: I’ve thought about the many feasts
8668: We went to, all in vain,
8669: Forfeits, and Hide and Seek,
8670: Couldn’t help, that’s plain:                                          5195
8671: Today the fools are out the trap,
8672: Darling, open then your lap,
8673: There’s someone you can gain.
8674: 
8675: (Other young and lovely girls join the Flower Girls, and they gossip
8676: together. Fishermen and bird-catchers with fishing rods, nests, limed twigs
8677: and other implements appear, and scatter themselves among the girls.
8678: Mutual attempts to win over, catch, escape and embrace, allow the most
8679: agreeable conversation.)
8680: 
8681: Wood-cutters (Entering, loudly and boisterously.)
8682: 
8683: Make way! Stand back!
8684: We must be free,                                                      5200
8685: We fell the trees,
8686: They crash, and smash:
8687: And when we pass,
8688: Expect a smack.
8689: To give us praise                         5205
8690: Consider this:
8691: If coarser ways,
8692: Weren’t in this land,
8693: How’d the finest,
8694: Have means to stand,                      5210
8695: Despite they’re jesting?
8696: So learn our meaning!
8697: For you’d be freezing,
8698: If we weren’t sweating.
8699: 
8700: Pulcinelli
8701: 
8702: You’re fools, a troop,                    5215
8703: That’s born to stoop.
8704: We’re the wise,
8705: We see through lies:
8706: And then our bags
8707: Our caps and rags,                        5220
8708: Are light to wear:
8709: And free from care,
8710: We’re always idle,
8711: Slippered, we sidle,
8712: Through market crowds,                    5225
8713: Slithering about,
8714: Standing to gaze,
8715: And croak, amazed:
8716: And at that sound,
8717: Through heaving mounds,                   5230
8718: Eel-like slipping,
8719: Lightly skipping,
8720: We romp together.
8721: Praise us ever,
8722: Or scold us so,                           5235
8723: We let both go.
8724: 
8725: The Parasitical (Fawning, and lustful.)
8726: 
8727: You brave woodsmen,
8728: And your next of kin,
8729: The charcoal-burners,
8730: You’re the men for us.                   5240
8731: Since all the stooping,
8732: The ready nodding,
8733: The winding phrase,
8734: That plays both ways,
8735: That warms or chills,                    5245
8736: Just as one feels,
8737: What profit is it then?
8738: The mighty fire
8739: From heaven or higher,                   5250
8740: Might come in vain
8741: Without logs again,
8742: And coal heaps there,
8743: To light the oven
8744: And make it glare.
8745: It roasts and steams,                    5255
8746: It boils and teems.
8747: The finger-picker,
8748: The plate-licker,
8749: He sniffs the fry,
8750: Suspects the fish:                       5260
8751: Rules, by and by,
8752: The patron’s dish.
8753: 
8754: A Drunk (Confused.)
8755: 
8756: Nothing seems bad to me today!
8757: I feel so frank, and free:
8758: New joys, and happy songs, I say.        5265
8759: I brought them both with me!
8760: So let’s drink! Drink, and drink!
8761: Drink up, you! Clink, and clink!
8762: You behind me, come around!
8763: Drink it up, and send it down.           5270
8764: 
8765: My wife was so outraged, she screamed,
8766: When I turned up, dressed so funny,
8767: However much I boasted, she
8768: Kept calling me a tailor’s dummy.
8769: So I drink! Drink, and drink!                                         5275
8770: Clink the tankards! Clink, and clink!
8771: Tailor’s dummy: swill it round!
8772: When it’s clinked, drink it down!
8773: 
8774: Don’t you say, I’ve lost my way:
8775: I’m here, where I’ve got it made.                                     5280
8776: If host and hostess won’t play,
8777: I’ll get credit from the maid.
8778: Always drinking! Drink, and drink!
8779: Lift, you others! Clink, and clink!
8780: Each to each! So it goes round!                                       5285
8781: Too soon, I know, it’s all gone down.
8782: 
8783: However I please myself, may I
8784: Have it happen at my command:
8785: Let me lie here, where I lie,
8786: If I can’t, any longer, stand.                                        5290
8787: 
8788: Chorus
8789: 
8790: Every pal, now: drink and drink!
8791: A toast again, a clink and clink!
8792: Hold tight now to bench and ground!
8793: Under the table, he’ll be found.
8794: 
8795: (The Herald announces sundry poets – Poets of Nature, and Court, and
8796: Minstrels, Sentimentalists and Enthusiasts. In this competitive crowd no one
8797: allows anyone else to start reciting. One slips by with a few words.)
8798: 
8799: A Satirical Poet
8800: 
8801: As a poet, do you know                                                5295
8802: What I’d most enjoy, here?
8803: If I dared to sing, or bellow
8804: What no one wants to hear.
8805: 
8806: (The Night and Church Poets excuse themselves having become engaged in
8807: a very interesting conversation with a newly-risen Vampire, from which a
8808: new school of poetry might derive. The Herald has to accept their excuses,
8809: and meanwhile calls on characters from Greek Mythology, who even in
8810: modern masks lose neither their character nor power to charm.)
8811: 
8812: (The Three Graces appear.)
8813: 
8814: Aglaia
8815: 
8816: Grace it is we bring, to living:
8817: So be graceful in your giving.                                    5300
8818: 
8819: Hegemone
8820: 
8821: Gracefully may you receive:
8822: Lovely is the wish achieved.
8823: 
8824: Euphrosyne
8825: 
8826: And in quieter hours, and places,
8827: Chiefly, in your thanks, be gracious.
8828: 
8829: (The Three Fates appear)
8830: 
8831: Atropos
8832: 
8833: I, the eldest, I, the spinning                                    5305
8834: Am lumbered with this time: I’ve
8835: Need of lots of pondering, thinking,
8836: To yield the tender threads of life.
8837: 
8838: So you may be soft and supple,
8839: I sift through the finest flax:                                   5310
8840: Drawn through clever fingers, double
8841: Fine, and even, smooth as wax.
8842: 
8843: If you wish all joy and dancing,
8844: Excessive now, in what you take,
8845: Think about those threads: their ending.                          5315
8846: Then, take care! The threads might break.
8847: Clotho
8848: 
8849: Know that in these latter days,
8850: I was trusted with the shears:
8851: Since our eldest sister’s ways,
8852: Failed to help men, it appears.         5320
8853: 
8854: She dragged all her useless spinning,
8855: Endlessly to air and light,
8856: While the hopes of wondrous winnings,
8857: Were clipped and buried out of sight.
8858: 
8859: I too made a host of errors:            5325
8860: Myself, in my younger years,
8861: But, to keep myself in check, there’s
8862: The case, in which I keep my shears.
8863: 
8864: And so, willingly restrained,
8865: I look kindly on this place,            5330
8866: In these hours, your freedom gained,
8867: Run on and on, at your wild pace.
8868: 
8869: Lachesis
8870: 
8871: I, the only one with sense,
8872: To twist the threads am left:
8873: My ways brook no nonsense,              5335
8874: I’ve never hurried yet.
8875: 
8876: Threads they come, threads I wind,
8877: Guiding each one on its track,
8878: Letting no thread wander blind,
8879: Twining each one in the pack.           5340
8880: 
8881: If I, once, forgot myself, my fears
8882: For the world would give me pause:
8883: Counting hours, measuring years,
8884: So the Weaver holds her course.
8885: Herald
8886: 
8887: You wouldn’t recognise the ones who come now,        5345
8888: However much you know of ancient troubles,
8889: To look at them, the cause of many evils,
8890: You’d call them welcome guests, and bow.
8891: 
8892: They’re the Furies: no one will believe me,
8893: Pretty, shapely, friendly, young in years:           5350
8894: But meet with them, you’ll quickly learn I fear,
8895: How serpent-like these doves are to hurt freely.
8896: 
8897: Though they’re malicious, in modernity,
8898: Where fools now boast about their sinful stories,
8899: They too have ceased to want the Angels’ glories:    5355
8900: Confess themselves the plague of land and city.
8901: 
8902: (The Furies approach.)
8903: 
8904: Alecto
8905: 
8906: What does that matter? You still believe in us:
8907: Then, we’re pretty, young, and fawning kittens:
8908: If one of you has a lover, with whom he’s smitten,
8909: We’ll tickle his ears at length, sweetly fuss,       5360
8910: 
8911: Till it would be safe to tell him, eye to eye,
8912: That she waves to him, and him, the same,
8913: She’s thick up top, a crooked back, and lame,
8914: And married, she’d be no good, by and by.
8915: 
8916: We know how to pester the bride-to-be as well:       5365
8917: Scarcely a week ago, her lover himself,
8918: Said nasty things to her about herself! –
8919: They’re reconciled, but something rankles still.
8920: Megaera
8921: 
8922: That’s a joke! Let them be married, any way,
8923: I’ll take it up, and know, whatever may befall,      5370
8924: Through wilfulness the sweetest joys will pall,
8925: Man’s changeable, and changeable the day.
8926: 
8927: And no one holds the desired one in his arms,
8928: Without longing, foolishly, for the more-desired,
8929: Leave’s his good fortune, with which he was fired:   5375
8930: Flies from the sun, and asks the frost for warmth.
8931: 
8932: I know how to give birth to those things: there,
8933: Is Asmodi, who is my faithful servant,
8934: To work true mischief at the proper moment,
8935: And send to ruin all Mankind, in pairs.              5380
8936: 
8937: Tisiphone
8938: 
8939: Instead of malice: poison and the knife
8940: I’m mixing, sharpening for that betrayer:
8941: Love another, and sooner now or later,
8942: Ruin itself will penetrate your life.
8943: 
8944: Gall and wormwood they must roam                     5385
8945: Through all those sweetest moments!
8946: No bargaining here, no bartering, come –
8947: The perpetrator must atone.
8948: 
8949: Let no one sing about forgiveness!
8950: I cry my cause to the cliffs again,                  5390
8951: Echo! Hear! Reply: Avenge!
8952: Let him who alters, cease existence.
8953: 
8954: The Herald
8955: 
8956: I’ll ask you please, to move aside,                  5395
8957: Since what comes next, is otherwise.
8958: You can see, here’s a mountain coming,
8959: Decked with princely coloured trappings,
8960: A tusked head, snaking trunk, there too,
8961: A mystery, but I’ll reveal the key to you.
8962: A delicate and dainty girl sits on its neck,
8963: And with a thin wand keeps the beast in check:      5400
8964: Another, up there, standing, wonderfully,
8965: Surrounded with light, almost blinding me.
8966: Beside it, two girls walk in chains, one fearful,
8967: While the other girl seems quite cheerful:
8968: One wishes to be, and one feels she is, free.       5405
8969: Let each of them declare who they might be.
8970: 
8971: Fear
8972: 
8973: Smoking torches, flares and lights,
8974: Are burning at the troubled feast:
8975: Among all these deceptive sights,
8976: Ah, I’m held fast by the feet.                      5410
8977: 
8978: Away, you ridiculous smilers!
8979: I suspect those grins so bright:
8980: All my enemies, beguilers,
8981: Press towards me through the night.
8982: 
8983: Here! A friend becomes a foe,                       5415
8984: Yet I know that mask, I’d say:
8985: One that wants to kill me, though,
8986: Now unmasked he creeps away.
8987: 
8988: Gladly, heedless of direction
8989: I’d escape from out this world:                     5420
8990: But, beyond, there roars destruction:
8991: In mists of terror I am furled.
8992: 
8993: Hope
8994: 
8995: I greet you, sisters! Though today,
8996: And the whole of yesterday,
8997: You enjoyed the masquerade,                         5425
8998: I know all will be displayed:
8999: In the morning you’ll unveil.
9000: And if, in the torchlight, we
9001: Don’t feel particular delight,
9002: Yet the days to come, so bright,              5430
9003: More wholly suited, we shall hail,
9004: Now as one, now solitary,
9005: Through fair fields, we’ll roam loose,
9006: To act, or rest, as we choose,
9007: And in that carefree way of living,           5435
9008: Dispense with nothing, go on striving:
9009: Guests are welcome everywhere,
9010: Confidently, let’s appear:
9011: Surely, the best anywhere,
9012: Must be somewhere, here.                      5440
9013: 
9014: Intelligence
9015: 
9016: Two of Man’s worst enemies,
9017: Fear and Hope, I bind for you,
9018: Now this country worries me.
9019: Make room! I’ll rescue you.
9020: 
9021: I lead the living Colossus,                   5445
9022: Turret-crowned, as you see,
9023: Step by step, he crosses,
9024: The highest passes, tirelessly.
9025: 
9026: But above me, on the summit,
9027: Is a goddess, there, who’s bearing            5450
9028: Outspread wings, and turns about,
9029: Everywhere, to see who’s winning.
9030: 
9031: Ringed by splendour, and by glory,
9032: Shining far, on every side:
9033: She calls herself – Victory,                  5455
9034: Goddess of the active life.
9035: 
9036: Zoilo-Thersites (An Ugly Dwarfish Warrior.)
9037: 
9038: Ah, ha! I’ve come just in time,
9039: I hold you all guilty of crime!
9040: Yet my goal I assume to be
9041: Her up there: Queen Victory.                  5460
9042: With her pair of snowy wings,
9043: She’s an eagle, she must think:
9044: And that whenever she’s on hand,
9045: To her belong the folk and land:
9046: But when famous deeds are done,               5465
9047: At once I’m here with armour on,
9048: When low is high, and high is low,
9049: Bent is straight, and straight not so,
9050: That alone fills me with mirth,
9051: I wish it so throughout the Earth.            5470
9052: 
9053: The Herald
9054: 
9055: So I’ll lend you, dog from birth,
9056: This good baton’s masterstroke!
9057: Twist and turn now: it’s no joke! –
9058: See how the twin dwarfish ape,
9059: Rolls into a foul lumpish shape!              5475
9060: A wonder – the lump’s an egg, on cue,
9061: It swells and then it cracks in two:
9062: Now a pair of twins appear,
9063: An adder and a bat roll clear.
9064: One through the dust is swiftly winding,      5480
9065: The black one’s flitting round the ceiling.
9066: They hurry outside, in company,
9067: I wouldn’t choose to be number three.
9068: 
9069: Murmurs
9070: 
9071: Lively now! There’s dancing there –
9072: No! I’d much rather be elsewhere –            5485
9073: Can’t you feel some ghostly race
9074: Fly about us, through this place? –
9075: Something just rushed through my hair –
9076: Round my feet, it’s flying, where? –
9077: None of us are injured though –               5490
9078: But we all are frightened so –
9079: All the fun is spoilt completely –
9080: As those creatures wished, you see.
9081: 
9082: The Herald
9083: 
9084: Since I play the herald’s role,
9085: As this masquerade unfolds,               5495
9086: I watch sternly at the door,
9087: In case some devious outlaw
9088: To this happy place, comes creeping:
9089: Never yielding, never wavering.
9090: Through the window, though, I fear        5500
9091: Airborne spectres enter here:
9092: From magic and from devilry
9093: Alas, I cannot set you free.
9094: All this makes the dwarf suspicious,
9095: Now! From behind, a new masque issues.    5505
9096: And I must dutifully explain
9097: The meaning of the forms, again.
9098: But I can’t easily announce
9099: What cannot be understood:
9100: Help me explain it, if you would! –       5510
9101: See it wander through the crowd?
9102: A splendid chariot, a four-in-hand,
9103: Rolling through them, where they stand:
9104: But it doesn’t split the people,
9105: I see no one’s crushed at all.            5515
9106: Colours glitter in the distance,
9107: Sundry wandering stars for instance,
9108: A magic-lantern-like performance.
9109: It blows along, a storm’s assault.
9110: Make way, there! I shudder!
9111: 
9112: The Boy Charioteer
9113:                             Halt!         5520
9114: Dragons, your wings restrain,
9115: Feel your accustomed rein,
9116: Control yourselves, if I control you,
9117: Sweep away when I inspire you –
9118: Let us do honour to this place!           5525
9119: Look round, a widening display
9120: Of admirers, circle now on circle.
9121: Herald, now, then! As you will,
9122: Before we leave you all,
9123: Describe us, and say our name:              5530
9124: Since we’re allegorical,
9125: You should know us, plain.
9126: 
9127: Herald
9128: 
9129: No, indeed, I can’t tell your name:
9130: I’ll try and describe you all the same.
9131: 
9132: The Boy Charioteer
9133: 
9134: So try!
9135: 
9136: The Herald
9137: 
9138:                            I must confess   5535
9139: To young and handsome, before the rest.
9140: You’re a half-grown boy: yet a woman
9141: Would prefer to see you fully grown.
9142: You seem to me a wooer, in future,
9143: Out of her house, a real seducer.           5540
9144: 
9145: The Boy Charioteer
9146: 
9147: Let’s hear more! Go on: go on,
9148: Find the riddle’s bright solution.
9149: 
9150: The Herald
9151: 
9152: Dark eyes that shine: night-black hair
9153: Which brightly jewelled bands enclose:
9154: And what a dainty garment flows             5545
9155: From shoulder down to ankle, there:
9156: With purple hem its glittering shows!
9157: One might take you for a girl:
9158: Yet for good or ill, you’d be,
9159: Prized already by any girl,                 5550
9160: She’d teach you your ABC.
9161: 
9162: The Boy Charioteer
9163: 
9164: And he, who like a splendid vision,
9165: Sits on the chariot, enthroned there?
9166: 
9167: The Herald
9168: 
9169: He seems a king, a rich and kind one,
9170: Blessed are they who gain his favour!       5555
9171: He has no further need to strive,
9172: His eyes observe whatever’s lacking,
9173: And to spread his pure delight,
9174: Is more to him than joy and owning.
9175: 
9176: The Boy Charioteer
9177: 
9178: You daren’t stop there: what you see,       5560
9179: You must describe it precisely.
9180: 
9181: The Herald
9182: 
9183: I can’t express all the dignity.
9184: But the glowing moon face, I see,
9185: The full mouth, the bright cheeks, then
9186: That shine beneath the jewelled turban:     5565
9187: Rich comfort in the clothes he’s wearing!
9188: What shall I say about his bearing?
9189: As a ruler he seems known to me.
9190: 
9191: The Boy Charioteer
9192: 
9193: Plutus the God of Riches, this is he!
9194: He’s come himself in all his splendour,     5570
9195: The Emperor wished greatly he were here.
9196: The Herald
9197: 
9198: Explain your own what and how to me!
9199: 
9200: The Boy Charioteer
9201: 
9202: I am Extravagance: I am Poetry:
9203: I am the Poet, who is self-perfected
9204: When his special gift is squandered.                     5575
9205: Yet I’m immeasurably wealthy,
9206: Like Plutus, worth as much as he,
9207: I adorn, enliven, dance and feast,
9208: And whatever he lacks, I complete.
9209: 
9210: Herald
9211: 
9212: Your boasting makes you handsomer,                       5580
9213: But let’s see all your skill appear.
9214: 
9215: The Boy Charioteer
9216: 
9217: Just watch me snap my fingers, now,
9218: The chariot will gleam and glow.
9219: There a string of pearls appear!
9220: 
9221: (He continues to snap his fingers, in all directions.)
9222: 
9223: Golden jewels for neck and ear:                          5585
9224: Flawless combs and diadems,
9225: Set in a ring, rare precious gems:
9226: I scatter flames too, here and there,
9227: Waiting for their chance to flare.
9228: 
9229: The Herald
9230: 
9231: How the dear crowd snatch, I see!                        5590
9232: The giver’s soon in difficulty.
9233: He snaps out jewels, as in a dream,
9234: And they all snatch them, in a stream.
9235: But now a different trick, you see:
9236: What each has grasped so eagerly,                     5595
9237: Has gained him but a poor reward,
9238: The gifts already fluttering skyward.
9239: The pearls are loosened from their band,
9240: And beetles crawl there in his hand,
9241: The poor man shakes them off, instead                 5600
9242: They’re humming now around his head.
9243: Another, for some solid thing,
9244: Catches at a butterfly’s wing.
9245: That’s what the rascal’s promise means:
9246: He only lends them golden gleams!                     5605
9247: 
9248: The Boy Charioteer
9249: 
9250: You know how to announce masks: it’s true,
9251: But it’s not the herald’s task to search below
9252: The outer surface of existence:
9253: That requires a keener sense.
9254: Still I’m wary of all disputes.                       5610
9255: Lord, I’ll direct my speech and questioning to you.
9256: 
9257: (Turning towards Plutus.)
9258: 
9259: Have you not trusted me with the task, to stand
9260: And guide the tempest of your four-in-hand?
9261: Don’t I steer well, as you direct?
9262: Am I not there, when you expect?                      5615
9263: And don’t I know how to win
9264: The palm, for you, on daring wing?
9265: When I’ve fought for you in war, now,
9266: I’ve been successful every time:
9267: When laurel wreaths adorn your brow                   5620
9268: Have I not fashioned them with hand and mind?
9269: 
9270: Plutus
9271: 
9272: If I’m required to be a witness to it,
9273: I’d say: You are the spirit of my spirit.
9274: You always act according to my wishes,
9275: And as I gain myself, you too are richer.             5625
9276: To reward your services, I value now
9277: The green branch higher than my crown.
9278: One true word, then, for everyone:
9279: I’ve found delight in you, dear Son.
9280: 
9281: The Boy Charioteer
9282: 
9283: The greatest gifts from my hand,             5630
9284: See! I’ve scattered them around.
9285: On every head there’s the glow
9286: Of some little flame I throw:
9287: Leaping from one brow to another,
9288: Halts on him, then leaves his brother,       5635
9289: But rarely does the flame-let rise,
9290: And briefly flower in bright skies:
9291: For many, before they know, it’s vanished,
9292: Sadly, it’s burnt out, and finished.
9293: 
9294: Women (Chatting to each other.)
9295: 
9296: Up there, on the four-in-hand,               5640
9297: He’s certainly a charlatan:
9298: And there’s a clown perched behind,
9299: By hunger and thirst he’s been refined,
9300: Like nothing one’s ever seen before:
9301: Pinch, and he’ll feel nothing at all.        5645
9302: 
9303: The Starveling
9304: 
9305: Disgusting women, leave me alone!
9306: Not to come here again, I’ll know.
9307: When women kept to their hearths, then
9308: Avaritia, Greed: was my name:
9309: The houses were fine, all about,             5650
9310: Lots came in, nothing went out!
9311: I took care of cupboard and chest:
9312: That was a burden, to top the rest.
9313: But now in this younger age,
9314: Wives don’t know how to save,                5655
9315: And like all those wicked students,
9316: They have more desires than ‘talents’,
9317: And their men have much to suffer,
9318: Their debts are left about all over.
9319: They spend whatever they can extract,       5660
9320: On their lovers, and on their backs:
9321: They eat of the best, and drink deeper,
9322: With their wretched army of admirers:
9323: Which adds to the value of gold, for me:
9324: We’re manly fellows, the Miserly!           5665
9325: 
9326: Leader of the Women
9327: 
9328: Let dragon be miserly with dragon:
9329: In the end it’s merely lies, illusion!
9330: Men flock around, and turn the charm on,
9331: But they’re soon annoyance and confusion.
9332: 
9333: The Crowd of Women
9334: 
9335: That Scarecrow! Give him a poke!            5670
9336: What’s the Wooden Rake threaten?
9337: We’ll all shun his ugly looks, then!
9338: Dragons of wood and paper: a joke!
9339: Look lively, now, and we’ll do him in!
9340: 
9341: The Herald
9342: 
9343: By my wand! Keep the peace! –               5675
9344: Though there’s no need for my assistance:
9345: Look at those grim monsters, how each
9346: Clears round itself a proper distance,
9347: Unfolding its quadruple wings, the beast.
9348: The dragons shake themselves, indignant,    5680
9349: With fiery throats, their tails rampant:
9350: The place is cleared: the people flee.
9351: 
9352: (Plutus descends from the chariot.)
9353: The Herald
9354: 
9355: He steps down, in a kingly manner!
9356: He beckons, and the dragons stir:
9357: From the chariot bearing Avarice,                  5685
9358: And gold, down comes the chest,
9359: See, there at his feet, it’s landed:
9360: It’s a wonder how it happened.
9361: 
9362: Plutus (To the Boy Charioteer)
9363: 
9364: Now you’ve left that troubling burden here,
9365: You’re free: so, fly now to your own sphere!       5690
9366: Not this! Where, confused, motley, wild,
9367: Distorted objects crowd around us, child.
9368: No: where you see clear, with sweetest Clarity,
9369: Self-possessed, trusting in your own self: flee,
9370: Where Goodness and Beauty may be viewed,           5695
9371: And there create your world – in Solitude!
9372: 
9373: The Boy Charioteer
9374: 
9375: So, I’ll be your worthy envoy then,
9376: So, I’ll love you like my dearest kin.
9377: Where you live, is Plenty: and where
9378: I am, all feel they gain in splendour.             5700
9379: And often hesitate in life’s uncertainty:
9380: Should they yield to you, or yield to me?
9381: Certainly your followers will have rest:
9382: Who follows me, with work’s forever blessed.
9383: My actions are never kept a secret,                5705
9384: I only have to breathe and I’m apparent.
9385: Farewell, then! You granted me my joy:
9386: But whisper low, and you shall have your boy!
9387: 
9388: (He exits as he came.)
9389: Plutus (Faust in disguise.)
9390: 
9391: And now it’s time to reveal the treasure!
9392: I strike the lock with the herald’s wand.            5710
9393: It’s open! Look! Vessels of noblest measure,
9394: Pour the golden blood through your hands,
9395: First it swells, roars, writhes as if it’s molten:
9396: A jewelled hoard of crowns, rings, and chains.
9397: 
9398: Various Shouts from the Crowd.
9399: 
9400: Look here, oh, there! How rich it flows:             5715
9401: The chest, right to the brim, it glows. –
9402: Golden vessels, molten too,
9403: Rolls of coins, turning too. –
9404: Minted ducats leaping,
9405: Oh, how my heart is beating –                        5720
9406: I see all, for which I’m yearning,
9407: On the floor there, burning! –
9408: It’s offered you, don’t be a fool,
9409: Be rich, you only need to stoop. –
9410: For, quick as lightning, all the rest,               5725
9411: Will take possession of the chest.
9412: 
9413: The Herald
9414: 
9415: What’s this, you Fools? Ah, yes,
9416: It’s no more than a maskers’ jest.
9417: Tonight, don’t ask for any more:
9418: Think you, we’d give you golden ore?                 5730
9419: In this game there are any amount
9420: Of pennies: too many for you to count.
9421: You clumsy idiots! A fine appearance,
9422: Seems, to you, truth’s naked essence.
9423: What is your Truth? – Hollow illusion                5735
9424: Grasps you, with its fool’s cap on. –
9425: Heroic Mask, Plutus that conceals,
9426: Drive these folk, then, from the field.
9427: Plutus
9428: 
9429: Your wand’s best by a mile,
9430: Lend it me for a little while. –              5740
9431: I’ll dip it, quick, in heat and glow. –
9432: You Maskers, all take care then, now!
9433: It gleams and bursts and throws off sparks!
9434: The wand already shines in the dark.
9435: And anyone who gets too near me,              5745
9436: Will be scorched, as well, mercilessly. –
9437: And now I’ll sweep with my brand.
9438: 
9439: Shouts and Confusion
9440: 
9441: Ah! We’re done for every man. –
9442: Fly, now, whoever can! –
9443: Back, back, the hindmost man! –               5750
9444: It’s shining brightly in my eyes. –
9445: On me the wand’s hot weight lies –
9446: We’re all lost, lost for good. –
9447: Back, back, you masks in flood!
9448: Back, back, you senseless mob! –              5755
9449: If I’d wings, I’d soar aloft. –
9450: 
9451: Plutus
9452: 
9453: The circle backwards sinks,
9454: Yet no one’s scorched, I think.
9455: The crowd will now give way,
9456: They’re only scared I’d say. –                5760
9457: But to guarantee good order,
9458: I’ll mark out an unseen border.
9459: 
9460: The Herald
9461: 
9462: You’ve done a fine job all right,
9463: Thanks to your cunning, and might.
9464: Plutus
9465: 
9466: Noble friend, you’ll still need patience:   5765
9467: All kinds of turmoil still threaten us.
9468: 
9469: Avarice
9470: 
9471: Now, if it pleases you, you may
9472: Cast your eye around with pleasure:
9473: The women are to the fore as ever,
9474: Where they can nibble things, or gaze.      5770
9475: Still, I’m not completely rusty!
9476: A lovely woman’s always lovely:
9477: And since, today, it costs me nothing,
9478: With confidence, I too go wooing.
9479: Still, here, in such a crowded space,       5775
9480: Lest words fall in an idle place,
9481: I’ll try being clever, attempt success,
9482: And in clear mime make my address.
9483: Hands, feet, gesturing won’t cut the ice,
9484: So, I’ll have to employ a comical device.   5780
9485: I’ll shape the gold like moistened clay,
9486: Since the metal’s malleable anyway.
9487: 
9488: The Herald
9489: 
9490: What’s he up to that skinny Fool!
9491: Is there a jest in the starveling too?
9492: He kneads the gold just like dough,         5785
9493: It’s soft between his hands, although
9494: However he squeezes and forms it all,
9495: It still remains a shapeless ball.
9496: He turns now towards the women,
9497: They all scream, and start to run,          5790
9498: Gesturing in complete disgust:
9499: That rascal’s up to no good.
9500: I fear he’ll be in ecstasy
9501: If he can offend morality.
9502: I shan’t remain silent, anyway              5795
9503: Give me the wand: I’ll drive him away.
9504: Plutus
9505: 
9506: He doesn’t see what we threaten here:
9507: Let him pursue his foolishness!
9508: There’ll be no room left for his excess:
9509: The law is great, but necessity’s greater.   5800
9510: 
9511: Tumult and Singing
9512: 
9513: The wild crowd come here, specially,
9514: From mountain-top, and wooded valley,
9515: Shouting forcefully, as they can:
9516: They celebrate the great god Pan.            5805
9517: They know what none can know,
9518: And into the empty circle flow.
9519: 
9520: Plutus
9521: 
9522: ‘I know you well, and your great Pan!
9523: Together these daring steps you plan.
9524: I know all that no one knows,
9525: And clear for you this narrow close.’        5810
9526: May good fortune follow them too!
9527: The strangest things may happen:
9528: They don’t know where they’re going to:
9529: Since they never look before them.
9530: 
9531: Wild Singing
9532: 
9533: You plaster people: you tinsel show!         5815
9534: Rough and coarse is how they go,
9535: Leaping: wild is their track ahead,
9536: Solid and sturdy is their tread.
9537: Fauns
9538: 
9539: The Faun flocks
9540: In happy dance,                          5820
9541: Oaken garlands,
9542: On curling locks,
9543: Fine pointed ears
9544: Through tangled hair,
9545: Snub noses, faces broad and flat,        5825
9546: The women can’t fault any of that:
9547: When the Fauns begin to prance,
9548: The loveliest won’t scorn the dance.
9549: 
9550: A Satyr
9551: 
9552: The Satyr’s leaping here behind,
9553: Goat’s foot, and lean of thigh,          5830
9554: Sinewy, skinny he’ll go by,
9555: And chamois-like, on mountain height,
9556: He looks around, and takes delight.
9557: He’s alive in the free air,
9558: Mocks at man, child, woman there,        5835
9559: Who deep in the valley’s damp flue,
9560: Think, cosily, they’re living too,
9561: While, still pure and undisturbed,
9562: To him alone is the upper world.
9563: 
9564: The Gnomes
9565: 
9566: The little crowd trips by there,         5840
9567: They don’t like to travel in pairs:
9568: In mossy clothes with lanterns bright,
9569: They pass together, quick and light,
9570: Each one passing on his own,
9571: Like glowing ants swarming home:         5845
9572: And always busy, here and there,
9573: Industrious, and everywhere.
9574: Kin to the ‘Little People’, known
9575: As surgeons to the rock and stone:
9576: ‘We bleed the mountains high,            5850
9577: We drain the deep veins dry:
9578: We hurl the metals round,
9579: With hearty greetings: Luck! Well found!
9580: And it’s always kindly meant: again,
9581: We’re the friends of all good men.                             5855
9582: Yet we the gold to light deliver,
9583: So men may steal, and covet ever,
9584: So princely hand won’t lack the steel
9585: That worldwide murder longs to deal.
9586: Who those three commandments breaks                            5860
9587: Scant heed of the other seven takes.
9588: But of all that we’re innocent:
9589: About it all, like us, be patient.’
9590: 
9591: The Giants
9592: 
9593: The wild men, we are named,
9594: Known in all the Hartz range:                                  5865
9595: Natural, plain, in all our antics,
9596: Appearing frightfully gigantic.
9597: A fir-tree trunk in each right hand,
9598: Round our body a thick band,
9599: A solid apron of branches, not                                 5870
9600: The bodyguard the Pope has got.
9601: 
9602: Nymphs in Chorus (Surrounding Great Pan, who is the masked Emperor.)
9603: 
9604: Here he’ll stand! –
9605: The world’s All,
9606: Is shown to all,
9607: In mighty Pan.                                                 5875
9608: You the happiest, surround him,
9609: In magic dances soar around him:
9610: Here now, serious and good, he
9611: Wishes all men to be happy.
9612: Under the curving roof of blue                                 5880
9613: He seems endlessly wakeful, too,
9614: Yet the streams flow gently for him,
9615: And the breezes gently rock him,
9616: And, when he sleeps at noon, the leaf
9617: Is motionless in the branches’ wreath:     5885
9618: The rich plants’ fragrant balsams there
9619: Fill all the still and silent air:
9620: The Nymph no longer dares to leap,
9621: And where she stands, falls fast asleep.
9622: But when his powerful shout,               5890
9623: Unexpectedly, rings out,
9624: Like thunder crack, or wave’s roar,
9625: Who knows what’s happening any more,
9626: The army’s witless in the fight,
9627: The hero in battle’s filled with fright.   5895
9628: So honour him, where honour’s due,
9629: And hail him, who led us to you!
9630: 
9631: A Deputation of Gnomes (To Great Pan.)
9632: 
9633: When the rich and shining goods,
9634: Spread threadlike through the deep,
9635: Then delicate divining rods,               5900
9636: Reveal what labyrinths keep.
9637: 
9638: Bending in our dark vaults, there,
9639: As troglodytes we’re measured,
9640: While in the purest daylight air,
9641: Gracious, you divide the treasure.         5905
9642: 
9643: Now we find we’ve discovered
9644: A marvellous fountain here,
9645: Promising, easily, to deliver
9646: Things that infrequently appear.
9647: 
9648: It all waits for your command:             5910
9649: Master, take and care for it: do.
9650: Every treasure in your hand,
9651: Helps the whole world too.
9652: Plutus (To the Herald.)
9653: 
9654: We must grasp things in the highest sense,
9655: And let what may come, come, with confidence.                      5915
9656: You’ve shown the highest courage once before.
9657: So now too what is fearful, we must try it:
9658: World, and posterity, will stubbornly deny it,
9659: So pen it faithfully in your report.
9660: 
9661: The Herald (Grasping the wand in Plutus’ hand, and assisting with the
9662: Masquerade.)
9663: 
9664: The dwarves lead on great Pan,                                     5920
9665: Gently, to the fiery fountain:
9666: It boils from the deep profound,
9667: Then sinks again, through the ground,
9668: And gloomy is its open round:
9669: Yet shows again the heat and glow.                                 5925
9670: Great Pan stands there, well disposed,
9671: Pleased with all this wondrous thing,
9672: Pearl foam, right, left, showering.
9673: How can he trust such a show?
9674: He bends to look inside, and so,                                   5930
9675: His beard gets caught within! –
9676: Who’s made that hairless chin?
9677: His hand hides it from our vision. –
9678: What follows is all clumsy action:
9679: The beard, on fire, flies back, soon                               5935
9680: Scorching garland, chest and head:
9681: Delight is turned to pain instead. –
9682: They rush to quench it all again,
9683: But none of them are free of flames,
9684: And how they flare and dart,                                       5940
9685: Exciting fire in every part:
9686: Wreathed in that element,
9687: The whole masked crowd is burnt.
9688: But what’s all this news about,
9689: Ear after ear, mouth after mouth!                                  5945
9690: O eternally unlucky night
9691: So little of it’s turned out right!
9692: Tomorrow’s dawn will declare
9693: What nobody wants to hear:
9694: In every ear we’ll hear it plain:             5950
9695: ‘The Emperor is in such pain.’
9696: O, would that it were something other!
9697: Burnt, Emperor and Court together.
9698: Cursed be those who led him astray,
9699: In resinous twigs did him array,              5955
9700: To rage, and bellow out that song,
9701: To the ruin of all that throng.
9702: O Youth, Youth will you never
9703: Restrict joy’s purest measure?
9704: O Power, Power, will you never,               5960
9705: Sense and Omnipotence treasure?
9706: The ‘forest’ too is soon in flames,
9707: The pointed tongues play their games,
9708: To the real wooden beams lick higher:
9709: We’re threatened by universal fire.           5965
9710: The cup of misery overflows,
9711: Who will save us? No one knows.
9712: See, Imperial splendour, by dawn’s light,
9713: Turned to a heap of ash, in a single night.
9714: 
9715: Plutus
9716: 
9717: That’s enough terror overhead,                5970
9718: Let help arrive here, instead! –
9719: Strike, you heavenly wand, with power,
9720: So the earth will ring and tremor!
9721: You, the wide realms of air,
9722: Fill with cool fragrance there!               5975
9723: Hurry down, to sweep around us,
9724: Cloudy mists and swelling vapours,
9725: Quench the thronging flames!
9726: Murmuring, trickling, fogs gather,
9727: Sliding, rolling, softly drenching,           5980
9728: Slipping everywhere, and quenching.
9729: You, the moist, who soothe forever,
9730: Change them all to gleaming weather,
9731: All these empty fiery games! –
9732: Threatening Spirits, that would harm,   5985
9733: We, by magic, will disarm.
9734: Part II Act I Scene IV: A Pleasure Garden in the Morning Sun
9735: 
9736: (The Emperor, his Court, Noblemen and Ladies: Faust and Mephistopheles
9737: dressed fashionably but not ostentatiously, both kneel.)
9738: 
9739: Faust
9740: 
9741: Sire, forgive the fiery conjuring tricks?
9742: 
9743: The Emperor (Beckoning to him to rise.)
9744: 
9745: More fun, in that vein, would be my wish. –
9746: At once, I saw myself in a glowing sphere,
9747: It seemed as if I were divine Pluto, there.                      5990
9748: A rocky depth of mine, and darkness, lay
9749: Glowing with flame: out of each vent played
9750: A thousand wild and whirling fires,
9751: And flickered in the vault together, higher,
9752: Licking upwards to the highest dome,                             5995
9753: That now seemed there, and now was gone.
9754: Through a far space wound with fiery pillars,
9755: I saw a long line of people approach us,
9756: Crowding till they formed a circle near,
9757: And paid me homage, as they do forever.                          6000
9758: From Court, I knew one face, and then another’s,
9759: I seemed the Prince of a thousand salamanders.
9760: 
9761: Mephistopheles
9762: 
9763: You are, Sire! Since every element
9764: Knows your Majesty, amongst all men.
9765: You’ve now proved the fire obedient:                             6005
9766: Leap in the sea, in its wildest torrent,
9767: You’ll barely touch its pearl-strewn bed,
9768: A noble dome will rise round you, instead:
9769: You’ll see green translucent waves swelling
9770: Purple edged, to make the loveliest dwelling,                    6010
9771: And you will be its centre. At each step
9772: Wherever you go, the palace follows yet,
9773: The very walls themselves delight in life,
9774: Flash to and fro, in swarming arrow-flight.
9775: Sea-wonders crowd around this sweet new sight,     6015
9776: Shoot past, still not allowed to enter quite.
9777: There, golden-scaled, bright sea-dragons play,
9778: The shark gapes wide, you smile in his face.
9779: However much your court attracts you now,
9780: You’ve never seen such an amazing crowd.           6020
9781: Nor will you part there from the loveliest:
9782: The Nereids will be gathering, curious,
9783: To this wondrous house, in seas eternally fresh,
9784: The youngest shy and pleasure-loving, like fish,
9785: The old ones: cunning. Thetis at the news,         6025
9786: Gives hand and lips to this second Peleus. –
9787: A seat there, on the height of Olympus, too…
9788: 
9789: The Emperor
9790: 
9791: I’ll leave the airy spaces all to you:
9792: Soon enough we’ll be climbing to that throne.
9793: 
9794: Mephistopheles
9795: 
9796: And, Sire, the Earth already is your own!          6030
9797: 
9798: The Emperor
9799: 
9800: What brought you here, now: what good fortune,
9801: Straight from the Thousand Nights and One?
9802: If you’re as fertile as Scheherezade
9803: I’ll guarantee you a sublime reward.
9804: Be ready then, when your world’s light,            6035
9805: As it often does, disappoints me quite.
9806: 
9807: The Steward (Entering hastily.)
9808: 
9809: Your Supreme Highness, I never thought
9810: To announce such luck, the finest wrought,
9811: As this is, for me the greatest blessing,
9812: Which I’ve revealed in your presence:              6040
9813: For debt after debt I’ve accounted,
9814: The usurer’s claws now are blunted,
9815: I’m free of Hell’s pain, and then,
9816: It can’t be any brighter in Heaven.
9817: 
9818: The Commander in Chief (Follows hastily.)
9819: 
9820: Something’s paid of what we owe,                  6045
9821: The Army’s all renewed their vow,
9822: The Cavalry’s fresh blood is up,
9823: And girls and landlords can sup.
9824: 
9825: The Emperor
9826: 
9827: Now your chests breathe easier!
9828: Now your furrowed brows are clear!                6050
9829: How quickly you hurried to the hall!
9830: 
9831: The Treasurer (Appearing.)
9832: 
9833: Ask them: it was they who did it all.
9834: 
9835: Faust
9836: 
9837: It’s right the Chancellor should read the page.
9838: 
9839: The Chancellor (Coming forward slowly.)
9840: 
9841: I’m happy enough to do so, in my old age. –
9842: See and hear the scroll, heavy with destiny,      6055
9843: That’s changed to happiness, our misery.
9844: ‘To whom it concerns, may you all know,
9845: This paper’s worth a thousand crowns, or so.
9846: As a secure pledge, it will underwrite,
9847: All buried treasure, our Emperor’s right.         6060
9848: Now, as soon as the treasure’s excavated,
9849: It’s taken care of, and well compensated.’
9850: The Emperor
9851: 
9852: I smell a fraud, a monstrous imposture!
9853: Who forged the Emperor’s signature?
9854: Have they gone unpunished for their crime?            6065
9855: 
9856: The Treasurer
9857: 
9858: Remember! You yourself it was that signed:
9859: Last night. You acted as great Pan,
9860: Here’s how the Chancellor’s speech began:
9861: ‘Grant yourself this great festive pleasure,
9862: The People’s Good: a few strokes of the feather.’     6070
9863: You wrote it here, and while night ruled the land,
9864: A thousand artists created another thousand,
9865: So all might benefit from your good deed,
9866: We stamped the whole series with your screed,
9867: Tens, Thirties, Fifties, Hundreds, all are done.      6075
9868: You can’t think how well the folk get on.
9869: See your city once half-dead with decay,
9870: Now all’s alive, enjoying its new day!
9871: Though your name’s long filled the world with glee,
9872: They’ve never gazed at it so happily.                 6080
9873: Now the alphabet’s superfluous,
9874: In these marks there’s bliss for all of us.
9875: 
9876: The Emperor
9877: 
9878: And my people value it as gold, you say?
9879: The Court and Army treat it as real pay?
9880: Then I must yield, though it’s wonderful to me.       6085
9881: 
9882: The Steward
9883: 
9884: It was impossible to catch the escapee:
9885: It flashed like lightning through the land:
9886: The moneychanger’s shops are jammed,
9887: Men pay, themselves, the papers mount
9888: They’re gold and silver, and at a discount.           6090
9889: Now used by landlords, butchers, bakers:
9890: Half the world think they’re merrymakers,
9891: The others, newly clothed, are on show.
9892: The drapers cut the cloth: the tailors sew.
9893: The toast is ‘Hail, the Emperor!’ in the bars,    6095
9894: With cooking, roasting, tinkling of jars.
9895: 
9896: Mephistopheles
9897: 
9898: Strolling, lonely, on the terrace,
9899: You see a beauty, smartly dressed,
9900: One eye hidden by her peacock fan,
9901: She smiles sweetly, looks at your hand:           6100
9902: And, quicker than wit or eloquence,
9903: Love’s sweetest favour’s arranged at once.
9904: You’re not plagued with pouch or wallet,
9905: A note beneath the heart, install it,
9906: Paired with love-letters, conveniently.           6105
9907: The priest carries his in a breviary,
9908: And wouldn’t the soldier be quicker on his way,
9909: With a lighter belt around his middle, say.
9910: Your Majesty will forgive me if, in miniature,
9911: I produce a low note, in our high adventure.      6110
9912: 
9913: Faust
9914: 
9915: The wealth of treasure that solidifies,
9916: That in your land, in deep earth lies,
9917: Is all unused. In our boldest thought,
9918: Such riches are only feebly caught:
9919: Imagination, in its highest flight,               6115
9920: Strives to, but can’t reach that height.
9921: But grasping Spirits, worthy to look deeply,
9922: Trust in things without limit, limitlessly.
9923: 
9924: Mephistopheles
9925: 
9926: Such paper’s convenient, for rather than a lot
9927: Of gold and silver, you know what you’ve got.     6120
9928: You’ve no need of bartering and exchanging,
9929: Just drown your needs in wine and love-making.
9930: If you lack coin, there’s moneychangers’ mile,
9931: And if it fails, you dig the ground a while.
9932: Cups and chains are auctioned: well,              6125
9933: Since the paper, in this way, pays for itself,
9934: It shames the doubters, and their acid wit,
9935: People want nothing else, they’re used to it.
9936: So now in all of your Imperial land
9937: You’ve gems, gold, paper enough to hand.          6130
9938: 
9939: The Emperor
9940: 
9941: The Empire thanks you deeply for this bliss:
9942: We want the reward to match your service.
9943: We entrust you with the riches underground,
9944: You are the best custodians to be found.
9945: You know the furthest well-concealed hoard,       6135
9946: And when men dig, it’s you must give the word.
9947: You masters of our treasure, then, unite,
9948: Accept your roles with honour and delight:
9949: They make the Underworld, and the Upper,
9950: Happy in their agreement, fit together.           6140
9951: 
9952: The Treasurer
9953: 
9954: No dispute will divide us in the future:
9955: I’m happy to have a wizard for a partner.
9956: 
9957: (He exits with Faust.)
9958: 
9959: The Emperor
9960: 
9961: Now, presents for the court: everyone
9962: Confess to me whatever it is you want.
9963: 
9964: A Page (Accepting his present.)
9965: 
9966: I’ll live well, happy, have the best of things.   6145
9967: Another (Also.)
9968: 
9969: I’ll quickly buy my lover chains and rings.
9970: 
9971: A Chamberlain
9972: 
9973: I’ll drink wines that are twice as fine.
9974: 
9975: A Second Chamberlain
9976: 
9977: The dice in my pockets itch I find.
9978: 
9979: A Knight (Thoughtfully.)
9980: 
9981: My lands and castle will be free of debt.
9982: 
9983: A Second Knight
9984: 
9985: It’s treasure: a second treasure I will get.        6150
9986: 
9987: The Emperor
9988: 
9989: I hoped for desire and courage for new deeds:
9990: But whoever knows you, thinks you slight indeed.
9991: I see, clearly: despite this treasure and more,
9992: You’re all the same, still, as you were before.
9993: 
9994: The Fool (Recovered, and approaching the throne.)
9995: 
9996: You’re handing presents out: give me one too!       6155
9997: 
9998: The Emperor
9999: 
10000: Alive again? You’d drink it all you fool.
10001: 
10002: The Fool
10003: 
10004: Magic papers! I don’t understand them, truly.
10005: The Emperor
10006: 
10007: That I’d believe: you’ll only use them badly.
10008: 
10009: The Fool
10010: 
10011: Others are falling: I don’t know what to do.
10012: 
10013: The Emperor
10014: 
10015: Just pick them up: those are all yours too.         6160
10016: 
10017: (The Emperor exits.)
10018: 
10019: The Fool
10020: 
10021: Five thousand crowns I’m holding, in my hand!
10022: 
10023: Mephistopheles
10024: 
10025: You two-legged wineskin, so you still stand?
10026: 
10027: The Fool
10028: 
10029: I’ve had my luck, but this is the best yet.
10030: 
10031: Mephistopheles
10032: 
10033: You’re so delighted: look, it’s made you sweat.
10034: 
10035: The Fool
10036: 
10037: But see here, is it truly worth real gold?          6165
10038: 
10039: Mephistopheles
10040: 
10041: You’ve there just what belly and throat are owed.
10042: The Fool
10043: 
10044: And can I buy a cottage, cow and field?
10045: 
10046: Mephistopheles
10047: 
10048: Why yes! There’s nothing to it: make a bid.
10049: 
10050: The Fool
10051: 
10052: A castle: with forests, hunting, fishing?
10053: 
10054: Mephistopheles
10055: 
10056:                                     Trust me!
10057: To see you a proper Lord would make me happy!      6170
10058: 
10059: The Fool
10060: 
10061: Tonight I’ll plant my weight on what I’ll get! –
10062: 
10063: (He Exits.)
10064: 
10065: Mephistopheles
10066: 
10067: Who doubts now that our Fool’s full of wit!

10069: 
10070: (Faust. Mephistopheles.)
10071: 
10072: Mephistopheles
10073: 
10074: Why bring me here to this dark passage?
10075: Isn’t there fun enough inside,
10076: In the Court’s colourful tide,                6175
10077: Opportunities for jests and sharp practice?
10078: 
10079: Faust
10080: 
10081: Don’t give me that: in the good old days
10082: You wore us out in a thousand ways:
10083: And now this wandering, there and here,
10084: Is only so I can’t catch your ear.            6180
10085: But there’s something I need done:
10086: Commander and Chamberlain egg me on.
10087: The Emperor, I must work quickly for him,
10088: Wants Helen and Paris to appear before him:
10089: He wants to see the ideal form of Man         6185
10090: Clearly revealed to him, and Woman.
10091: Get to work! I daren’t break my word.
10092: 
10093: Mephistopheles
10094: 
10095: Such a thoughtless promise was absurd.
10096: 
10097: Faust
10098: 
10099: Friend, you haven’t considered
10100: Where your powers have lead us:               6190
10101: First we made him rich, and how,
10102: So he wants us to amuse him now.
10103: 
10104: Mephistopheles
10105: 
10106: You think it’s fixed that quickly:
10107: We’re looking at a deeper track,
10108: To the strangest realm, and wickedly,              6195
10109: Adding new faults to the old,
10110: Do you think it’s easy to call Helen back,
10111: Like a pasteboard spirit edged with gold –
10112: Witch-bitches, ghost-hostesses, freely,
10113: Or dwarf-maidens, I’ll serve you equally:          6200
10114: But Devil’s sweethearts, though you’re for them,
10115: Still you can’t, as heroines, applaud them.
10116: 
10117: Faust
10118: 
10119: Still the same old story, every day!
10120: With you, things are always difficult.
10121: You’re the father of all obstacles,                6205
10122: For every miracle you want more pay.
10123: I know: a little muttering, and it’s done:
10124: At a blink, you’ll bring her here.
10125: 
10126: Mephistopheles
10127: 
10128: With Pagan folk I don’t get on:
10129: They live in their own Hell there:                 6210
10130: Yet, there is a way.
10131: 
10132: Faust
10133: 
10134:                            Tell, without delay!
10135: 
10136: Mephistopheles
10137: 
10138: Unwillingly! There’s a greater mystery, I say,
10139: Goddesses, enthroned on high, and solitary.
10140: No space round them, not even time: only
10141: To speak of them embarrasses me.                   6215
10142: They are The Mothers!
10143: 
10144: Faust (Terrified.)
10145: 
10146:                            Mothers!
10147: Mephistopheles
10148:                             Are you afraid?
10149: 
10150: Faust
10151: 
10152: The Mothers! Mothers! It sounds so strange!
10153: 
10154: Mephistopheles
10155: 
10156: As, it is. Goddesses, unknown, as you see,
10157: To you Mortals, not named by us willingly.
10158: You must dig in the Depths to reach them:          6220
10159: It’s your own fault that we need them.
10160: 
10161: Faust
10162: 
10163: Where is the path?
10164: 
10165: Mephistopheles
10166:                  No path! Into the un-enterable,
10167: Never to be entered: One path to the un-askable,
10168: Never to be asked. Are you ready?
10169: No locks, no bolts to manipulate,                  6225
10170: You’ll drift about in solitary space.
10171: Can you conceive the waste and solitary?
10172: 
10173: Faust
10174: 
10175: I think you might spare the speeches then:
10176: They always smell of the witches’ kitchen,
10177: Of a long forgotten time, to me.                   6230
10178: Have I not trafficked with the world?
10179: Learned the void, the void unfurled? –
10180: When I spoke with reason, as I descried,
10181: Contradiction, doubly loud, replied:
10182: Have I not fled, from hateful trickery,            6235
10183: Into the wild, into the solitary,
10184: And, not to lose all, and live alone,
10185: Surrendered to the Devil’s own?
10186: Mephistopheles
10187: 
10188: And if you’d swum through every ocean,
10189: And seen the boundless space all round                 6240
10190: You’d still have seen wave on wave in motion,
10191: Though you might have been afraid to drown.
10192: You’d have seen something. Seen, within
10193: The green still seas, the leaping dolphin:
10194: Seen clouds go by, Sun, Moon and star –                6245
10195: You’ll see none in the endless void, afar,
10196: Hear not a single footstep fall,
10197: Find no firm place to rest at all.
10198: 
10199: Faust
10200: 
10201: You speak as chief of all Mystagogues, who
10202: Deceive their neophytes, the loyal and true:           6250
10203: Only reversed. You send me to the Void,
10204: So I’ll increase the power and skill employed:
10205: To use me, like a cat, that’s your desire:
10206: Just to claw your chestnuts from the fire.
10207: The same as ever! I’ll find what I’ll discover:        6255
10208: In your Nothingness, I hope, the All I will recover.
10209: 
10210: Mephistopheles
10211: 
10212: I’ll praise you, before you separate from me,
10213: That you know the Devil, I can truly see:
10214: Here take this key.
10215: 
10216: Faust
10217:                             That tiny thing!
10218: 
10219: Mephistopheles
10220: 
10221: Grasp it, it has a worth you’re undervaluing.          6260
10222: Faust
10223: 
10224: It’s growing in my hand, it shines and glows!
10225: 
10226: Mephistopheles
10227: 
10228: What one possesses in it, would you now know?
10229: The key will sniff the place out, from all others.
10230: Follow it down: it leads you to the Mothers.
10231: 
10232: Faust
10233: 
10234: The Mothers! That always strikes me like a blow!      6265
10235: What is that word that, once heard, scares me so?
10236: 
10237: Mephistopheles
10238: 
10239: Are you so limited one new word disturbs you?
10240: Will you only hear what you’re accustomed to?
10241: Don’t be troubled, whatever strange sound rings,
10242: You’ve already long been used to marvellous things.   6270
10243: 
10244: Faust
10245: 
10246: Yes, there’s no good for me in lethargy.
10247: A shudder’s the truest sign of humanity:
10248: Though the world is such we may not feel it,
10249: Once seized by it, we feel Immensity deeply.
10250: 
10251: Mephistopheles
10252: 
10253: Then, descend! I might as easily say rise!            6275
10254: It’s all the same. Escape from what exists,
10255: Into the boundless realm where all Form lies!
10256: Delight in what’s no longer on the list:
10257: Where turmoil rolls along all cloudily:
10258: Then, far from your body, swing the key!              6280
10259: Faust (Inspired.)
10260: 
10261: Good! I feel new strength, firmly grasped,
10262: My heart expands, on now to the great task.
10263: 
10264: Mephistopheles
10265: 
10266: Sight of a glowing tripod will tell you, finally,
10267: You’re in the last deep, deepest there might be.
10268: By its light you’ll see the Mothers,                    6285
10269: Some sit about, as they wish, the others,
10270: Stand and move. Formation, Transformation,
10271: Eternal minds in eternal recreation.
10272: Images of all creatures float, portrayed:
10273: They’ll not see you: they only see a shade.             6290
10274: Be of good heart, the danger there is great,
10275: Go to the tripod: don’t hesitate,
10276: And touch it with the key!
10277: 
10278: (Faust assumes a commanding attitude with the key.)
10279: 
10280: Mephistopheles (Watching him.)
10281: 
10282:                                         That’s right!
10283: It will close itself, and follow as a servant might:
10284: Exalted by your good luck, you’ll calmly rise,          6295
10285: And be back with it, before you’ve blinked your eyes.
10286: And, once you’ve brought it here all right,
10287: Call the Hero and Heroine from the night,
10288: The first man who has ever achieved it:
10289: It’s done, and you’re the one who did it.               6300
10290: By magic process then you’ll surely find,
10291: The incense’ vapour will become divine.
10292: 
10293: Faust
10294: 
10295: And now: what?
10296: Mephistopheles
10297: 
10298:       Strain with all your being: downward.
10299: Stamp to descend, stamp again to go upward.
10300: 
10301: (Faust stamps and sinks out of sight.)
10302: 
10303: If he might only gain some good from that key!   6305
10304: I’m curious as to whether he’ll return to me.

10308: 
10309: The Chamberlain (To Mephistopheles)
10310: 
10311: You still owe us that scene with the Spirits:
10312: The Emperor’s impatient. Get on with it!
10313: 
10314: The Steward
10315: 
10316: That’s what His Grace just now was saying:
10317: You! Don’t offend His Majesty by delaying.        6310
10318: 
10319: Mephistopheles
10320: 
10321: That’s why my companion has just gone:
10322: He knows how to put the whole thing on,
10323: And has to labour away in silence: still,
10324: All the most special diligence he applies:
10325: He who’d own that treasure, the Beautiful,        6315
10326: Needs highest arts, the magic of the wise.
10327: 
10328: The Steward
10329: 
10330: The arts you need are neither here nor there:
10331: The Emperor orders it to be prepared.
10332: 
10333: A Blonde Lady (Approaching Mephistopheles.)
10334: 
10335: Sir, a word! You see a clear complexion,
10336: Yet it’s not so in summertime’s dejection!        6320
10337: A hundred red-brown freckles all sprout there,
10338: And cover my white skin: I’m in despair.
10339: A cure!
10340: Mephistopheles
10341: 
10342:      A pity! Such a shining beauty,
10343: Spotted like a panther-cub, in May!
10344: Take frogspawn, toads’ tongues, in cohabitation,     6325
10345: Skilfully, under a full moon, make a distillation,
10346: When it wanes, apply it undiluted,
10347: When spring comes, the spots have been uprooted.
10348: 
10349: A Dark-haired Lady
10350: 
10351: The crowd are pressing round to squeeze you dry.
10352: I ask a cure! For a frozen foot                      6330
10353: That hinders me in dancing, walking by,
10354: And I curtsey awkwardly to boot.
10355: 
10356: Mephistopheles
10357: 
10358: Permit a little kick from my foot.
10359: 
10360: The Dark-haired Lady
10361: 
10362: Well, between lovers that’s occurred before.
10363: 
10364: Mephistopheles
10365: 
10366: Child! My kick means something more.                 6335
10367: Like cures like, when one’s suffering:
10368: Foot heals foot, and so with every member.
10369: Come! Pay attention! No retaliation there.
10370: 
10371: The Dark-haired Lady (Crying out.)
10372: 
10373: Ouch! Ouch! That hurt! I call that kicking
10374: Like a horse’s hoof.
10375: Mephistopheles
10376: 
10377:                 With that the cure I bring.       6340
10378: You can indulge in any amount of dancing,
10379: Touch feet under the table with your darling.
10380: 
10381: A Lady (Pushing forward.)
10382: 
10383: Let me through! My suffering is so great,
10384: He used to hold me in his heart’s embrace:
10385: Yesterday his joy was in my glances,              6345
10386: He turns his back on me: with her romances.
10387: 
10388: Mephistopheles
10389: 
10390: That’s serious, but listen to me now.
10391: You must gently press your advances,
10392: Take this charcoal: mark him anyhow,
10393: On his cloak or on his sleeve alight,             6350
10394: He’ll feel sweet Remorse’s blow.
10395: Swallow the charcoal straight away,
10396: No wine or water on your lips all day:
10397: He’ll be sighing at your door tonight.
10398: 
10399: The Lady
10400: 
10401: It’s not poisonous?
10402: 
10403: Mephistopheles (Offended.)
10404: 
10405:                 Respect now, where it’s due!      6355
10406: You’d have to travel far to find such charcoal:
10407: It comes from the dying pyre at a funeral,
10408: On which I, once more, diligently blew.
10409: 
10410: A Page
10411: 
10412: I’m in love: they say I’m not old enough to.
10413: Mephistopheles (Aside.)
10414: 
10415: I’m not sure now, whom I should listen to.            6360
10416: 
10417: (To the Page.)
10418: 
10419: Don’t set your heart on the younger ones.
10420: The older will value what they’ve won.
10421: 
10422: (Others crowd round.)
10423: 
10424: More, already! What a demanding crew!
10425: I’ll help myself, and out now with the truth:
10426: The worst expedient! The pain is great, you see. –    6365
10427: O Mothers, Mothers! Just let Faust go free!
10428: 
10429: (Gazing round him.)
10430: 
10431: The lights burn dim, already, in the hall,
10432: The Court’s moving off, and they’re all
10433: Arranged in their proper rank, I see,
10434: Through the far aisles and galleries.                 6370
10435: Now they assemble in the largest place,
10436: The vast Hall of the Knights, there’s barely space,
10437: Who bought the mass of bright tapestry,
10438: Filled corners, niches like an armoury.
10439: Here I doubt there’s need of magic spells:            6375
10440: The ghosts will find this place for themselves.

10444: 
10445: The Herald
10446: 
10447: My ancient duty, to announce the play,
10448: Is thwarted by the Spirits’ secret action:
10449: Please forgive: there’s no sensible way
10450: To explain such confused transformation.                      6380

10452: The emperor’s high up, by the wall:
10453: He can see the battles on the tapestry
10454: From mighty ages: watching comfortably.
10455: Here they all sit now, Prince, Court around,                  6385
10456: Benches packed together, as background:
10457: In this hour of spirits, too, the lovers
10458: Have lovingly found room beside their lovers.
10459: And now that all have found their proper places,
10460: We’re ready: let the spirits show their faces!                6390
10461: 
10462: (Trumpets.)
10463: 
10464: The Astrologer
10465: 
10466: Begin the drama then without delay,
10467: The Emperor commands: take walls away!
10468: No further hindrance, here magic is at hand:
10469: The Tapestry’s shrivelled as if by burning brand.
10470: The walls divide, and sweep apart, as one,                    6395
10471: An empty stage it seems has been created,
10472: A mysterious light falls on our faces,
10473: And I climb up to the proscenium.
10474: Mephistopheles (Rising to view in the prompter’s box.)
10475: 
10476: From here I hope for general acclamation,
10477: Prompting is the devil’s true oration.                         6400
10478: 
10479: (To the Astrologer.)
10480: 
10481: You know the measures that all the stars obey,
10482: You’ll understand my whispers in a masterly way.
10483: 
10484: The Astrologer
10485: 
10486: By miraculous power appears to view,
10487: A massive temple-front: it’s ancient too.
10488: Like Atlas, who once held up the sky,                          6405
10489: The many rows of columns stand on high.
10490: They might well bear the stony weight,
10491: Since two could raise a building straight.
10492: 
10493: The Architect
10494: 
10495: That’s the antique! It doesn’t earn my praise,
10496: Clumsy, overstretched we call it, nowadays.                    6410
10497: Men think that crude is noble: bulk is greatness.
10498: I love slender shafts, uplifting, boundless:
10499: A pointed arch sends the spirit to the sky:
10500: Architecture such as that will edify.
10501: 
10502: The Astrologer
10503: 
10504: Receive with reverence these hours the stars allow:            6415
10505: Let words of magic bind pure Reason now:
10506: Let marvellously daring Fantasy,
10507: In return, sweep onward, wide and free.
10508: Your eyes see what you daringly conceived:
10509: It’s impossible, so more worthy to be believed.                6420
10510: 
10511: (Faust rises into view on the other side of the proscenium.)
10512: In priestly vestments, crowned, a wondrous man,
10513: Fulfilling what he confidently began.
10514: A tripod rises with him from deep abyss,
10515: I smell the odour of incense in the dish.
10516: He prepares to bless this sacred labour:           6425
10517: From this moment on it will find favour.
10518: 
10519: Faust (Sublimely.)
10520: 
10521: In your name, Mothers, you enthroned
10522: In boundlessness, set eternally alone,
10523: And yet together. All the Forms of Life
10524: Float round your heads, active, not alive.         6430
10525: Whatever was, in all its glow and gleam,
10526: Moves there still, since it must always be.
10527: And you assign it, with omnipotent might,
10528: To day’s pavilion or the vault of night.
10529: Life holds some fast on its sweet track,           6435
10530: Others the bold magician must bring back:
10531: Filled with faith, and richly generous,
10532: He shows, what each desires, the Marvellous.
10533: 
10534: The Astrologer
10535: 
10536: The glowing key has scarcely touched the dish,
10537: At once the room is filled with darkened mist:     6440
10538: It swirls about, as puffs of cloud will do,
10539: Grows, condenses, shrinks, and splits in two.
10540: And now behold a spirit-masterpiece!
10541: As it moves about, there’s music without cease.
10542: In heavenly tones, pours out a who-knows-how,      6445
10543: And while it moves, all’s turned to melody now.
10544: The pillared shafts, even the tri-glyph, ringing
10545: I think that the whole temple’s singing.
10546: The dark sinks down: from the light mist,
10547: A handsome youth steps out in time to it.          6450
10548: I needn’t name him, so my task is finished,
10549: Who doesn’t know the name of charming Paris!
10550: A Lady
10551: 
10552: O! What a shining healthy powerful youth!
10553: 
10554: A Second
10555: 
10556: Like a peach, so fresh and full of juice!
10557: 
10558: A Third
10559: 
10560: The finely delineated, sweetly swelling lip!   6455
10561: 
10562: A Fourth
10563: 
10564: From such a cup you’d surely like to sip?
10565: 
10566: A Fifth
10567: 
10568: He’s quite pretty, but a little unrefined.
10569: 
10570: A Sixth
10571: 
10572: He could be a bit more graceful, to my mind.
10573: 
10574: A Knight
10575: 
10576: I sense the shepherd here, I think,
10577: No trace of Courtier or Prince.                6460
10578: 
10579: Another
10580: 
10581: Yes! Half naked the youth’s quite handsome
10582: We’d need to see him first with armour on!
10583: 
10584: A Lady
10585: 
10586: He sits down so gently and pleasantly.
10587: A Knight
10588: 
10589: You’d like to sit on his lap, comfortably?
10590: 
10591: Another
10592: 
10593: He lifts his arm so lightly above his head.       6465
10594: 
10595: A Chamberlain
10596: 
10597: The lout! That’s not acceptable: how ill-bred!
10598: 
10599: A Lady
10600: 
10601: You lords find fault with everything.
10602: 
10603: The Chamberlain
10604: 
10605: In the Emperor’s presence, all that stretching!
10606: 
10607: The Lady
10608: 
10609: He’s posed there! He thinks he’s quite alone.
10610: 
10611: The Chamberlain
10612: 
10613: Even a play should be polite in tone.             6470
10614: 
10615: The Lady
10616: 
10617: Now sleep has overcome the charming boy.
10618: 
10619: The Chamberlain
10620: 
10621: And now he’ll snore: that’s natural, what joy!
10622: A Young Lady
10623: 
10624: What refreshes my heart so deeply, that fragrance
10625: Mixed with fumes from the burning incense?
10626: 
10627: An Older Lady
10628: 
10629: Truly! It’s breath penetrates one’s nature,          6475
10630: It comes from him!
10631: 
10632: An Elderly lady
10633: 
10634:                 It’s the sap of nurture,
10635: It’s generated in youth, like ambrosia,
10636: And spreads around in the atmosphere.
10637: 
10638: (Helen emerges.)
10639: 
10640: Mephistopheles
10641: 
10642: So that’s her! I’d not lose sleep for that. She
10643: Is quite pretty, true, but doesn’t do much for me.   6480
10644: 
10645: The Astrologer
10646: 
10647: There’s nothing more now for me to do,
10648: As men of honour confess, I confess it too.
10649: Beauty comes: if only I’d a tongue of fire! –
10650: Beauty so many songs has forever inspired –
10651: Whom she appears to, of self he’s dispossessed,      6485
10652: Whom she belonged to, was too greatly blessed.
10653: 
10654: Faust
10655: 
10656: Is this the fount of beauty? Have I still, eyes?
10657: What pours here, through my mind, so richly?
10658: My dreadful journey yields a blessed prize.
10659: How void the world was, undeveloped for me!          6490
10660: What is it now since my priesthood?
10661: Desirable, lasting, solid underfoot!
10662: The power of my life’s breath should
10663: Fail, if I’m ever again estranged from you! –
10664: The perfect form that drew me before,              6495
10665: Delighting me, in the magic mirror,
10666: Was only an airy phantom of such beauty! – You
10667: Are the true embodiment of my passion:
10668: Towards you is my powers’ whole direction
10669: To you, love, feeling, faith, madness are owed.    6500
10670: 
10671: Mephistopheles (From the prompter’s box.)
10672: 
10673: Calm yourself, now, and don’t fail in your role!
10674: 
10675: An Older Lady
10676: 
10677: Tall, well formed, only the head is small.
10678: 
10679: A Younger Lady
10680: 
10681: Just look! Could clumsier feet exist at all?
10682: 
10683: A Diplomat
10684: 
10685: I’ve seen princesses of this kind: though
10686: I think she’s beautiful, from head to toe.         6505
10687: 
10688: A Courtier
10689: 
10690: Soft and sly, she goes towards the sleeper.
10691: 
10692: A Lady
10693: 
10694: How ugly, near that form so young and pure.
10695: 
10696: A Poet
10697: 
10698: From her Beauty shines towards him.
10699: A Lady
10700: 
10701: A picture! Luna and Endymion!
10702: 
10703: The Poet
10704: 
10705: Quite so! The goddess seems to descend,           6510
10706: Leans above him to drink his breath, ah then:
10707: Enviable! – A Kiss! – The cup’s full to excess.
10708: 
10709: A Duenna
10710: 
10711: In front of everyone! What utter madness!
10712: 
10713: Faust
10714: 
10715: A dreadful favour to grant a boy! –
10716: 
10717: Mephistopheles
10718: 
10719:                Quiet now! Be still!
10720: And let the spectre do what it will.              6515
10721: 
10722: A Courtier
10723: 
10724: She slips away, lightly: he awakes.
10725: 
10726: A Lady
10727: 
10728: Just as I thought! That glance she takes!
10729: 
10730: A Courtier
10731: 
10732: He stares! It’s wonderful what’s happening.
10733: 
10734: A Lady
10735: 
10736: But not so wonderful what she sees in him.
10737: A Courtier
10738: 
10739: She turns towards him now with dignity.           6520
10740: 
10741: A Lady
10742: 
10743: I see she’ll soon take him through his lesson:
10744: At such times men behave quite stupidly,
10745: Perhaps he even thinks that’s he the first one.
10746: 
10747: A Knight
10748: 
10749: Let me be worthy! Majestically fine! –
10750: 
10751: A Lady
10752: 
10753: The trollop! I’d call that table wine!            6525
10754: 
10755: A Page
10756: 
10757: I’d like to swap his place for mine!
10758: 
10759: A Courtier
10760: 
10761: Who wouldn’t be tangled in such a net?
10762: 
10763: A Lady
10764: 
10765: That treasure’s been handled often, you forget,
10766: And the gilding’s mostly rubbed away.
10767: 
10768: Another
10769: 
10770: Worthless since it was ten years old, I’d say.    6530
10771: 
10772: A Knight
10773: 
10774: Sometimes one takes the best that one can get:
10775: I’d be content with the loveliness that’s left.
10776: A Learned Man
10777: 
10778: I see clearly but I’ll confess, quite freely,
10779: It’s doubtful if that’s the true one I see.
10780: The Present’s tempted to exaggerate,              6535
10781: I hold to what the ancient texts relate.
10782: There I read she gave particular joy
10783: To all the grey-bearded men of Troy:
10784: And that fits perfectly here too, you see:
10785: I’m not young: still she gives joy to me.         6540
10786: 
10787: The Astrologer
10788: 
10789: No longer a boy! A daring hero, he:
10790: Grasped she defends herself, but barely.
10791: He lifts her high in his strong arms, too,
10792: Will he carry her off?
10793: 
10794: Faust
10795:                            Audacious fool!
10796: You dare? Do you hear? Stop! Enough, I say!       6545
10797: 
10798: Mephistopheles
10799: 
10800: You created the mime these phantoms play!
10801: 
10802: The Astrologer
10803: 
10804: A word! After what we’ve been given,
10805: I’ll call this piece: The Rape of Helen.
10806: 
10807: Faust
10808: 
10809: What rape! Am I nothing in this place!
10810: Is this key no longer in my hand!                 6550
10811: It led me through terror, waste and wave,
10812: Through solitude, to where, set firm, I stand.
10813: Here’s a foothold! Here’s reality,
10814: Where spirit dare with spirits disagree,
10815: And prepare itself for its great, dual mastery.   6555
10816: She was so far: how could she closer shine!
10817: I’ll rescue her, and she’ll be doubly mine.
10818: The risk! The Mothers! They must grant her!
10819: Who knows her once, can never live without her.
10820: 
10821: The Astrologer
10822: 
10823: What are you doing, Faust! Faust! –With force                            6560
10824: He seizes her, the form dims in its course.
10825: He turns the key against the youth, and then,
10826: Touches him! – Ah! – Gone, in a moment! Gone!
10827: 
10828: (An explosion. Faust falls to the ground. The spirits vanish in mist.)
10829: 
10830: Mephistopheles (Taking Faust on his shoulders.)
10831: 
10832: You’ve done it now! Carrying fools, my friend,
10833: Brings harm to the Devil himself, in the end.                            6565
10834: 
10835: (Darkness. Tumult.)
10836: Part II Act II Scene I: A High-Arched, Narrow, Gothic Chamber
10837: Formerly Faust’s, Unchanged
10838: 
10839: Mephistopheles (Entering from behind a curtain. As he holds it up and
10840: looks behind him, Faust is seen lying stretched out on an antiquated bed.)
10841: 
10842: Lie there, unlucky man! One tempted by
10843: The bonds of a love not readily undone!
10844: The man whom Helena shall paralyse
10845: Won’t find it easy to regain his reason.
10846: 
10847: (Looking around him.)
10848: 
10849: I look upwards, here, around me,                                        6570
10850: All’s unaltered, and undamaged:
10851: Stained glass, there, shows darkly,
10852: Spiders have added to their webs:
10853: The ink is dry: the paper’s yellow,
10854: But everything’s still in its place:                                    6575
10855: Even the quill-pen’s here, on show,
10856: With which Faust and the Devil embraced.
10857: Yes! Deeper in the nib there’s still
10858: A drop of blood, I tempted him to spill.
10859: It’s a unique piece, in my book,                                        6580
10860: So I’ll wish the great collectors luck.
10861: The old fur-robe, on the hook, too,
10862: Reminds me of a joke or two,
10863: That time when I taught the student,
10864: What, perhaps, in youth, he’s glad he learnt.                           6585
10865: Truly the same desire is on me, for
10866: You, smoke-singed gown: you and I,
10867: To flaunt ourselves once more as a professor,
10868: And speak as one who’s always in the right.
10869: How to achieve that all the learned know:                               6590
10870: It’s something the Devil lost long ago.
10871: 
10872: (He shakes the fur as he takes it down, and moths, crickets and beetles fly
10873: out.)
10874: Chorus of Insects
10875: 
10876: Greetings! We’re greeting
10877: Our Patron of old,
10878: We’re floating and buzzing,
10879: To us you’re well known.                          6595
10880: Singly, in silence,
10881: You sowed us like plants.
10882: Father, in thousands
10883: We’ve come to the dance.
10884: The jester is snugly                              6600
10885: Contained in the breast,
10886: The lice in the fur they
10887: Are sooner expressed.
10888: 
10889: Mephistopheles
10890: 
10891: What a nice surprise, this young brood of mine!
10892: One merely sows, and harvests in due time.        6605
10893: I’ll shake this ancient fleece about,
10894: Here and there, one flutters out. –
10895: Away! Around! In a hundred leavings,
10896: Hurry and hide yourself, you darlings.
10897: There, where the ancient boxes lie,               6610
10898: Here, in the smoky parchment try,
10899: In that broken dusty old pottery,
10900: Or the skull, its eye-sockets empty.
10901: All this jumbled mildewed existence,
10902: Always gives one whims and fancies.               6615
10903: Again let’s dress up as a lecturer!
10904: Today I’ll be the Principal, once more.
10905: But it’s no use naming myself, you see:
10906: Where are the people, to welcome me?
10907: Famulus (A College Servant, tottering here, down the long gallery)
10908: 
10909: What a noise! What a quake!                                          6620
10910: The stairs sway, the walls shake:
10911: Through the windows’ trembling colours
10912: I see the lightning gleam above us.
10913: The floor leaps, and, on high,
10914: Plaster, rubble from the sky.                                        6625
10915: And the door, once tightly locked,
10916: By wondrous force is thrown back. –
10917: There! How fearful! A giant
10918: Look, in Faust’s old garment!
10919: At his gazing, and his pleas,                                        6630
10920: I want to sink to my knees.
10921: Shall I go? Shall I remain?
10922: Oh, what will happen to me, then!
10923: 
10924: Mephistopheles
10925: 
10926: Here, my friend! – You’re called Nicodemus.
10927: 
10928: Famulus
10929: 
10930: Honoured Sir! That’s my name – Oremus.                               6635
10931: 
10932: Mephistopheles
10933: 
10934: Enough of that!
10935: 
10936: Famulus
10937: 
10938:    How pleased I am you knew me!
10939: 
10940: Mephistopheles
10941: 
10942: I know you well: a student still, I see,
10943: Mossy Sir! After all, a learned man
10944: Studies hard, and does the best he can.
10945: So one builds a respectable house of cards,                          6640
10946: That greater minds can’t finish afterwards.
10947: But he’s a witty fellow, is your master,
10948: Who doesn’t know the noble Doctor Wagner?
10949: He’s the first in all the world of learning!
10950: He’s unique: wisdom, each day increasing,
10951: And all of it he still holds together,           6645
10952: Crowds, around him, panting, gather
10953: Listeners, eaves’-droppers, welcome.
10954: Alone, he shines there at the rostrum.
10955: He holds a key, just like Saint Peter,           6650
10956: That unlocks the lower, and the higher.
10957: He glows and sparkles above the rest,
10958: No name and fame has wider standing:
10959: Even that of Faust has dimmed, at best:
10960: He’s the one who’s always inventing.             6655
10961: 
10962: Famulus
10963: 
10964: Forgive me, honoured Sir, if I dare
10965: To speak, and contradict you, there:
10966: There’s no question of that, I must declare:
10967: Since modesty’s his role, as all discern.
10968: Discovering nothing of the circumstances,        6660
10969: Baffled by the great man’s disappearance:
10970: He seeks all health and comfort in his return.
10971: The room waits for its old master
10972: While Doctor Faustus is away,
10973: Untouched, still, as in his day.                 6665
10974: And I scarcely dare to enter.
10975: What can the stars be doing? –
10976: The walls themselves are frightening me:
10977: The doorframes quiver, bolts work free,
10978: Or you yourself couldn’t have got in.            6670
10979: 
10980: Mephistopheles
10981: 
10982: And your great man where is he?
10983: Lead me there: or bring him here to me!
10984: Famulus
10985: 
10986: Oh! His warnings are quite clear,
10987: I’m not allowed to interfere.
10988: For months I’ve left him in utter peace,                  6675
10989: Till his great work is complete.
10990: He, the most delicate of scholars,
10991: His face looks like a charcoal burner’s,
10992: Blackened now from nose to ears,
10993: Eyes crimson, blowing up the fires,                       6680
10994: All the while, so enthusiastic:
10995: Clinking of tongs, that’s his music.
10996: 
10997: Mephistopheles
10998: 
10999: Why would he deny an entrance to me?
11000: I’m one who’d speed his luck, you see.
11001: 
11002: (The Famulus exits: Mephistopheles sits down, gravely.)
11003: 
11004: I’ve hardly taken my seat here,                           6685
11005: And I see a guest behind my chair.
11006: But he’s one of the new school’s persuasion:
11007: He’ll be arrogant, I think, on this occasion.
11008: 
11009: Baccalaureus (Storming along the corridor.)
11010: 
11011: I find the gates and doors are open!
11012: Now there’s room at last for hope then,                   6690
11013: That it won’t be merely as before,
11014: A live man, acting as a corpse,
11015: Wasting away, and rotting,
11016: Till he merely dies of living.
11017: 
11018: These walls and these partitions,                         6695
11019: Bow and sink towards perdition,
11020: And if we don’t look about us,
11021: Their decline and fall will rout us.
11022: I’m audacious, no one more so,
11023: But no further in do I go.                                6700
11024: What will I find here today?
11025: It’s years since I’ve been this way,
11026: Where timid and innocent
11027: As a freshman I was sent!
11028: Where I trusted in my elders,             6705
11029: Edified by all their blather.
11030: 
11031: From the dry old books, they knew
11032: They lied to me: what they knew,
11033: Not believing in it truly,
11034: Stealing life itself, from me.            6710
11035: What? – There, in his cell,
11036: Sits a darkly bright one still!
11037: 
11038: With astonishment now, nearer,
11039: See him sitting in his dark fur,
11040: Truly, as I left him sitting              6715
11041: Still in all his coarse wrapping!
11042: Then he seemed a fount of wisdom,
11043: Since I didn’t understand him.
11044: He won’t find me so today,
11045: Fresh and new, I’m on my way!             6720
11046: 
11047: Sir, if in Lethe’s melancholy stream
11048: That bald nodding head’s not swum,
11049: See your grateful scholar come,
11050: Outgrown, his academic dream.
11051: I find you now, as I saw you:             6725
11052: I was another though: that’s true.
11053: 
11054: Mephistopheles
11055: 
11056: I’m glad the ringing brought you.
11057: I rated you once before as high:
11058: The caterpillar, the chrysalis too,
11059: Showed the bright future butterfly.       6730
11060: Your curly hair and pointed collar,
11061: Made you a childishly pleasing scholar.
11062: You never wore pigtails I believe? –
11063: And today you’re cropped like a Swede.
11064: I see you’re bold and resolute:                         6735
11065: But don’t go home too absolute!
11066: 
11067: Baccalaureus
11068: 
11069: My old master! We’re in our old places:
11070: But don’t think to renew time’s journey,
11071: And spare me words with dual-faces:
11072: I treat them now quite differently.                     6740
11073: You teased the true, and honest youth.
11074: It wasn’t difficult for you to do
11075: It’s what no one dares to do today.
11076: 
11077: Mephistopheles
11078: 
11079: Pure truth on the young is thrown away,
11080: The little beaks don’t like it, any way,                6745
11081: But afterwards when years have passed,
11082: And they’ve learnt it for themselves at last,
11083: And think it came from them, not school:
11084: Then we hear: ‘The Master was a fool.’
11085: 
11086: Baccalaureus
11087: 
11088: A rascal, maybe! – What teacher ever shows us           6750
11089: The Truth directly, underneath our noses?
11090: They know the way to make it seem more, or less,
11091: Now serious, now playful, as suits the children best.
11092: 
11093: Mephistopheles
11094: 
11095: There’s a moment given us for learning, truly:
11096: But you’re ready now to teach, yourself, I see.         6755
11097: For many moons, united with their suns,
11098: You the riches of experience have won.
11099: Baccalaureus
11100: 
11101: Experience! Mist and Foam!
11102: And not the Spirit’s equal.
11103: Confess! What one has known,                       6760
11104: Is not worth knowing at all.
11105: 
11106: Mephistopheles (After a pause.)
11107: 
11108: I’ve thought so for ages. I was a Fool,
11109: But I think that shallow now I’m sensible.
11110: 
11111: Baccalaureus
11112: 
11113: That pleases me! I hear pure Reason’s sound:
11114: The first old man of sense I’ve ever found.        6765
11115: 
11116: Mephistopheles
11117: 
11118: I sought for treasure, buried gold,
11119: And brought to light frightful coals.
11120: 
11121: Baccalaureus
11122: 
11123: Confess now, your skull, bald and old,
11124: Is worth no more than that empty poll.
11125: 
11126: Mephistopheles (Amiably.)
11127: 
11128: Do you know, my friend, how rude you seem to me?   6770
11129: 
11130: Baccalaureus
11131: 
11132: In German, one’s lying if one speaks politely.
11133: Mephistopheles (Wheeling his chair nearer to the proscenium and the
11134: audience.)
11135: 
11136: Up here I’m dazed by light and air:
11137: Shall I take shelter with you down there?
11138: 
11139: Baccalaureus
11140: 
11141: I find it arrogant that in times like these,
11142: A man wants to be what he no longer is.                           6775
11143: Man’s life is in his arteries, and when
11144: Are they so vibrant as in younger men?
11145: There the fresh blood full of strength
11146: Creates new life from its own life again.
11147: There all works, and things get done,                             6780
11148: The waverers fall, the capable get on.
11149: While we’ve conquered half the world,
11150: What have you done? Nodded, curled
11151: In the sun, dreamed, weighed, plan on plan.
11152: For sure, age is a chilling fever:                                6785
11153: The frost of whims and need ahead.
11154: When your thirtieth year is over,
11155: A man’s as good as dead.
11156: It would be best to seek an early grave.
11157: 
11158: Mephistopheles
11159: 
11160: That leaves the Devil nothing more to say.                        6790
11161: 
11162: Baccalaureus
11163: 
11164: Unless I will it, no Devil can exist.
11165: 
11166: Mephistopheles (Aside.)
11167: 
11168: The Devil will still trip you, in a bit.
11169: 
11170: Baccalaureus
11171: 
11172: This is youth’s noblest profession!
11173: The world was nothing before my creation:
11174: I drew the Sun out of the sea:                                  6795
11175: The Moon began her changeful course with me:
11176: The daylight decked my path to greet me,
11177: The Earth flowered, grew green, to meet me.
11178: At my command, in primal night,
11179: The stars in splendour swam to sight.                           6800
11180: Who, but I, loosed from its prison
11181: Cramped thought’s philistinism?
11182: I, quite free, as my spirit cites,
11183: Happily following my inner light,
11184: And speeding on, in delight,                                    6805
11185: Darkness behind: and all before me, bright.
11186: 
11187: Mephistopheles
11188: 
11189: Go forth in splendour, you primal man! –
11190: How could insight harm you, ever:
11191: Who can think of stupid things or clever,
11192: That past ages didn’t, long ago, understand.                    6810
11193: Yet there’s no danger from him, you see,
11194: He’ll think about it differently in time:
11195: Even if the grape-juice acts absurdly,
11196: In the end it changes into wine.
11197: 
11198: (To the younger members of the audience, who do not applaud.)
11199: 
11200: My words have left you cold, I gather,
11201: May it be so for you, sweet children:
11202: But think: the Devil’s a lot older,
11203: So you need to be old to understand him!
11204: Part II Act II Scene II: A Laboratory
11205: 
11206: (In the fashion of the Middle Ages: lots of heavy apparatus for strange
11207: purposes.)
11208: 
11209: Wagner (At the furnace.)
11210: 
11211: The fearful bell is sounding,
11212: The soot-black walls shudder.                                             6820
11213: My deepest expectation
11214: Will be unsure no longer.
11215: Soon the dark itself will lighten:
11216: Soon in the innermost phial,
11217: It will glow like living fire,                                            6825
11218: Yes, like the noblest ruby’s glow,
11219: Lightning flashing in the shadow.
11220: A clearest white light shines now!
11221: Ah, not to lose it once more! –
11222: Oh, God! Who’s rattling at the door?                                      6830
11223: 
11224: Mephistopheles (Entering.)
11225: 
11226: Greetings! And kindly meant now.
11227: 
11228: Wagner (Anxiously.)
11229: 
11230: Welcome, to the planet of the hour!
11231: 
11232: (Whispering.)
11233: 
11234: But stifle your breath, and words’ power,
11235: A noble work is likewise being weighed.
11236: 
11237: Mephistopheles (Whispering.)
11238: 
11239: What might it be?
11240: 
11241: Wagner (Whispering.)
11242: 
11243:                     A Man is being made.                                  6835
11244: Mephistopheles
11245: 
11246: A Man? And what loving couple
11247: Have you got hidden, up the chimney?
11248: 
11249: Wagner
11250: 
11251: God Forbid! How unfashionable!
11252: We’re free of all that idle foolery.
11253: The tender moment from which life emerged,        6840
11254: The charming power with which its inner urge,
11255: Took and gave, and clearly stamped its seal,
11256: First in a near, and then a further field,
11257: We now divest of all that dignity:
11258: Though the creatures still enjoy it, we,          6845
11259: As Men, with all our greater gifts, begin,
11260: To have, as we should, a nobler origin.
11261: 
11262: (He turns towards the furnace.)
11263: 
11264: It brightens! See! – Now there’s a real chance,
11265: That, if from the hundred-fold substance,
11266: By mixing – since mixing makes it happen –        6850
11267: The stuff of human life’s compounded,
11268: And distilled in a flask, well-founded,
11269: And in proper combination, grounded,
11270: Then the silent work is done.
11271: 
11272: (He turns again to the furnace.)
11273: 
11274: It will be! The mass is clearer!                  6855
11275: The proof comes nearer, nearer:
11276: What man praises in deepest Nature,
11277: Through Reason we dare to probe it,
11278: And what she organises, here,
11279: We’re now able to crystallise it.                 6860
11280: Mephistopheles
11281: 
11282: Who lives a while, gains much experience,
11283: And nothing new can happen on his journey.
11284: In years of travelling, and in my presence,
11285: I’ve seen, already, crystallised humanity.
11286: 
11287: Wagner (Up till now attending to the phial.)
11288: 
11289: It rises: flashes, there’s expansion           6865
11290: In a moment more it will be done.
11291: Great aims seem foolish at the outset:
11292: But we’ll laugh at Chance itself, yet,
11293: And brains, with thoughts to celebrate,
11294: In the future, a Thinker will create.          6870
11295: 
11296: (He inspects the phial, rapturously.)
11297: 
11298: The glass rings with sweet power,
11299: It darkens, clears: it must have being!
11300: In a delicate form I see appear
11301: A well-behaved little Man behaving.
11302: What can the world ask more, what can we?      6875
11303: Now that this mystery’s visible to each.
11304: Give ear to what these sounds may be,
11305: They make a voice: they’re forming speech.
11306: 
11307: Homunculus (From the phial, to Wagner.)
11308: 
11309: Now, father! That was no joke. How are you?
11310: Come: press me tenderly to your heart, too!    6880
11311: But not too hard, the glass may be too thin.
11312: It’s in the very nature of the thing:
11313: For the natural the world has barely space:
11314: What’s artificial commands a narrow place.
11315: 
11316: (To Mephistopheles.)
11317: 
11318: But you, Rascal, my dear Cousin, are you       6885
11319: Here at the right moment? I thank you, too.
11320: Good fortune’s led you here to me:
11321: Since I exist, I must be doing, you see.
11322: I’d like to begin my work today:
11323: You’re skilful at shortening the way.                            6890
11324: 
11325: Wagner
11326: 
11327: But first, a word! Till now I’ve had no direction,
11328: When old or young teased me with a question.
11329: For example: no one’s found out, ever,
11330: What makes body and soul fit together:
11331: Stick tight, as if there’ll be no separation,                    6895
11332: Yet always cause each other irritation.
11333: So then, -
11334: 
11335: Mephistopheles
11336: 
11337:                 Stop! I’d rather he told me,
11338: Why married people get by so wretchedly?
11339: You’ll never discover that, my friend.
11340: There’s work to do the little Man can tend.                      6900
11341: 
11342: Homunculus
11343: 
11344: What work’s to do?
11345: 
11346: Mephistopheles (Pointing to a side door.)
11347: 
11348:              Employ your gifts on this!
11349: 
11350: Wagner (Still gazing at the phial.)
11351: 
11352: Truly, you’re the loveliest boy there is!
11353: 
11354: (The side-door opens: Faust is seen stretched out on a couch.)
11355: Homunculus (Astonished.)
11356: 
11357: Interesting!
11358: 
11359: (The phial slips out of Wagner’s hands, hovers over Faust, and shines on
11360: him.)
11361: 
11362:        Lovely surroundings! – Clear water
11363: In thick forest! Women there: undressing.
11364: The loveliest of all! – It’s getting clearer.                        6905
11365: One’s left, different from the rest, gleaming:
11366: Of highest race, for sure, a heavenly name.
11367: She places her foot in the transparent glow,
11368: Her noble body’s sweetly living flame
11369: Cools itself in the yielding crystal flow. –                         6910
11370: But what’s that rush of beating wings for:
11371: That thrashing, splashing, in the mirror?
11372: The lovely girls, intimidated, flee:
11373: Their queen, alone, looks on, composedly,
11374: To see, with a proud feminine pleasure,                              6915
11375: The Swan-Prince press against her knee, there,
11376: Forward yet tame. Familiar, he seems. –
11377: But suddenly a vapour heaves,
11378: And covers, with the veil it weaves,
11379: The loveliest of scenes.                                             6920
11380: 
11381: Mephistopheles
11382: 
11383: All the things that you could murmur!
11384: So little: and such a great dreamer.
11385: I see nothing –
11386: 
11387: Homunculus
11388: 
11389:         So I believe. You’re Northern,
11390: In the age of mist you’re born then,                                 6925
11391: In a jumble of priest-craft and chivalry,
11392: So how could your sight be free!
11393: You’re at home with darkness.
11394: (He gazes around.)
11395: 
11396: Brown repulsive, mildewed walls,
11397: Low, pointed arches, full of scrolls! –
11398: One wakes, and gives another pain,         6930
11399: On the spot, dead then, he’ll remain.
11400: Wooded founts, swans, naked beauty,
11401: That was his far-sighted dream:
11402: How could this place do duty!
11403: I can scarcely endure the scene.           6935
11404: Carry him off!
11405: 
11406: Mephistopheles
11407: 
11408:   I’d be happy: a last chance.
11409: 
11410: Homunculus
11411: 
11412: Order the soldier to the fight,
11413: Lead the maiden to the dance,
11414: Then everything’s done right.
11415: Even now, thinks, quick as light,          6940
11416: It’s Classical Walpurgis Night:
11417: That’s the best, if he were sent
11418: To his own true element!
11419: 
11420: Mephistopheles
11421: 
11422: I’ve never heard that event named, here.
11423: 
11424: Homunculus
11425: 
11426: How could it come to your ear?             6945
11427: Only Romantic ghosts, for you:
11428: A true ghost must be Classic too.
11429: Mephistopheles
11430: 
11431: Which path do we take there? Already
11432: Your antique colleagues quite repel me.
11433: 
11434: Homunculus
11435: 
11436: North-westward Satan, is your pleasure ground,        6950
11437: But this time we’re South-eastward bound –
11438: In wider space flows Peneus, the free
11439: By bushes, groves, and damp still bays:
11440: Its levels stretch to mountain ways,
11441: And over it Pharsalus: old, yet contemporary.         6955
11442: 
11443: Mephistopheles
11444: 
11445: Oh! Enough! And keep all the fight,
11446: Of tyranny and slavery, out of sight.
11447: It bores me: they’re scarce done when
11448: They start the whole thing over again:
11449: And no one sees: they’re being re-aligned,            6960
11450: By Asmodeus, who works them from behind.
11451: They clash, it’s said, for Freedom’s right:
11452: Seen rightly, slave with slave is all the fight.
11453: 
11454: Homunculus
11455: 
11456: Leave Mankind’s wilfulness to me, then.
11457: Each man defends himself, as best he can,             6965
11458: From childhood, till, at last, he is a man.
11459: Just ask how we can get back there again.
11460: Have you a method, then, let’s see:
11461: If you haven’t, leave it all to me.
11462: 
11463: Mephistopheles
11464: 
11465: There’s many a Brocken trick I could display,         6970
11466: But I find that Pagan bolts have barred the way.
11467: The whole Greek race was never that much use!
11468: They dazzle with the senses’ freer play: it’s true:
11469: They lure the heart of man to happier sins:
11470: While ours, one always finds, are gloomy things.   6975
11471: And now, what?
11472: 
11473: Homunculus
11474: 
11475:             Once you weren’t so witless:
11476: When I spoke about Thessalian witches.
11477: I can deliver what I said: just think a little.
11478: 
11479: Mephistopheles (Lustfully.)
11480: 
11481: Thessalian witches! Good! They’re the people
11482: I once enquired about long ago.                    6980
11483: I don’t think it would suit me, at all,
11484: To live with them night after night, though,
11485: Still, a visit, and a trial –
11486: 
11487: Homunculus
11488: 
11489:                  This mantle here,
11490: Fold it around your knight there!                  6985
11491: As before, the cloak can carry another,
11492: One of you, along with the other.
11493: I’ll light the way.
11494: 
11495: Wagner (Anxiously.)
11496: 
11497:                      And I?
11498: 
11499: Homunculus
11500: 
11501:                               Well, now, you
11502: Stay home, there are important things to do.
11503: Unfold all your ancient parchments,
11504: Then, by rote, collect life’s elements,            6990
11505: And place them together with due care,
11506: Consider What, more deeply consider How.
11507: Meanwhile round the world, a bit, I’ll fare,
11508: And find the last dot on the ‘i’, for now.
11509: Then the great work will see its final stage:       6995
11510: Great effort will merit great reward, you’ll see:
11511: Gold, honour, fame, a long and ripe old age,
11512: And science too – and virtue, possibly.
11513: Farewell!
11514: 
11515: Wagner (Sadly.)
11516: 
11517:            Farewell! It gives me pain.
11518: Already, I fear, I’ll not see you again.            7000
11519: 
11520: Mephistopheles
11521: 
11522: Now to Peneus, lively, on!
11523: Sir Cousin’s highly rated.
11524: 
11525: (To the audience.)
11526: 
11527: In the end we’re dependent on
11528: The creatures we’ve created.
11529: Part II Act II Scene III: Classical Walpurgis Night.
11530: The Pharsalian Fields.
11531: 
11532: (Darkness.)
11533: 
11534: Erichtho (The Thessalian Witch, see Lucan’s Pharsalia)
11535: 
11536: This night’s awesome feast, as so often in the past,        7005
11537: I enter now, I, Erichtho, the gloomy one:
11538: Not so abominable as the wretched poets
11539: Painted me, with excessive slander…they never
11540: Cease their blame or praise…I see the valley whiten
11541: With waves of tents that gleam greyer in the distance,      7010
11542: The after-image of that anxious, fearful night.
11543: How often it’s repeated! In eternity
11544: Acted out, again, forever…No one gives the realm
11545: To another: to the one whose power won it:
11546: Whose strength rules. Since each, incapable of ruling       7015
11547: His inner self, would gladly rule his neighbour’s will,
11548: In the manner that his proud mind dictates to him…
11549: But here a great instance was fought out, to the end,
11550: Of how force may battle against a greater force,
11551: Freedom’s lovely thousand-blossomed garland be torn,        7020
11552: And stubborn laurel be wound round the ruler’s brow.
11553: Here, Pompey dreams of his youth and former greatness,
11554: There, Caesar, listening, watches the balance tremble!
11555: It settles, and the world knows whom it sinks towards.
11556: The watch fires, glowing, send out their crimson flames:    7025
11557: The field exhales those images of squandered blood,
11558: And lured by the strange wondrous splendour of the night,
11559: A legion of Hellenic legends gather here.
11560: They hover around all the fires uncertainly,
11561: Or sit nearby, the fabled forms of ancient days….           7030
11562: The Moon, not full it is true, but of clearest light,
11563: Rises, scattering mild radiance everywhere:
11564: The ghostly tents vanish: the fires burn bluish now.
11565: But, over my head, what sudden meteor’s this?
11566: It shines, illuminates the material globe.                  7035
11567: I smell Life. It’s not fitting for me to approach
11568: Closer to the living, since I’m harmful to them:
11569: It gives me a bad name, and is no benefit to me.
11570: It sinks down already. I give way, thoughtfully!
11571: 
11572: (She Exits. The Airy Travellers speak from above.)
11573: 
11574: Homunculus
11575: 
11576: Once again float round the circle                    7040
11577: Over flames and shuddering horror:
11578: On the ground, and in the vale still,
11579: It’s quite ghostly, we discover.
11580: 
11581: Mephistopheles
11582: 
11583: It’s the same as through my old window
11584: In the grim and tangled north,                       7045
11585: Really loathsome ghosts below,
11586: I’m at home here: and there, of course.
11587: 
11588: Homunculus
11589: 
11590: See! There’s a tall one striding,
11591: With gigantic steps, before us.
11592: 
11593: Mephistopheles
11594: 
11595: As if she were afraid, now: gliding                  7050
11596: Through the air above, she saw us.
11597: 
11598: Homunculus
11599: 
11600: Let her stride! Right away,
11601: Set the knight down there:
11602: He’ll return to life again,
11603: Once he breathes this mythic air.                    7055
11604: Faust (As he touches the ground.)
11605: 
11606: Where is she?
11607: 
11608: Homunculus
11609: 
11610:                  We can’t say, I fear,
11611: But you can probably enquire here.
11612: Hurry now before it’s daylight,
11613: Go and search, from fire to fire:
11614: Who found his way to the Mothers’ side,        7060
11615: Won’t find this harder to survive.
11616: 
11617: Mephistopheles
11618: 
11619: On my own behalf too, I’m here:
11620: But I don’t know anything better
11621: Than each to seek, among the fires,
11622: The adventure he desires.                      7065
11623: Then, so that we can reunite,
11624: Little one, shine your ringing light.
11625: 
11626: Homunculus
11627: 
11628: It shines like this, and rings.
11629: 
11630: (The glass shines and rings out powerfully.)
11631: 
11632: Now off to new and wondrous things!
11633: 
11634: Faust (Alone.)
11635: 
11636: Where is she? – But no further answer seek…    7070
11637: If this is not the soil she trod,
11638: Nor the wave that bathed her foot,
11639: It is the air that spoke her speech.
11640: Here! By a miracle, on Hellenic land!
11641: I feel, the earth, too, where I stand:         7075
11642: A fresh power glows in me, the Sleeper,
11643: So I am Antaeus-like in nature.
11644: And I find the strangest things lie here,
11645: First let me search this Labyrinth of fire.
11646: 
11647: (He moves away.)
11648: (On the Upper Peneus)
11649: 
11650: Mephistopheles (Looking around.)
11651: 
11652: And as I wander through these fires,                            7080
11653: I feel myself a total stranger: in the event,
11654: They’re mostly naked, a shirt here and there:
11655: The Sphinx shameless, the Gryphon impudent:
11656: And what’s more, curly-haired and winged,
11657: Before, behind, in eyes, reflected things…                      7085
11658: Of course, at heart, indecency’s my ideal,
11659: But I find the Antique is a little too real.
11660: One should control all with a modern mind,
11661: Overlay it with fashions of assorted kinds….
11662: Repulsive people! Yet still I have to meet them,                7090
11663: And, as a new guest too, correctly greet them…
11664: Luck to you, fair ladies, and men, you wise grey ones!
11665: 
11666: A Gryphon (Snarling. For the gold-guarding Gryphons see Herodotus’
11667: Histories.)
11668: 
11669: Not Grey ones! Gryphons! – No one likes the name
11670: Of something grey. Every word rings
11671: With what conditioned it: its origins:                          7095
11672: Grey, grievous, grumpy, gruesome, gravely, grimly,
11673: Similarly harmonious etymologically,
11674: Disharmonise us.
11675: 
11676: Mephistopheles
11677: 
11678:                        And yet, without deviation,
11679: You like the gryp in your proud name of Gryphon.
11680: 
11681: The Gryphon (Snarling continuously.)
11682: 
11683: Naturally! The relationship’s tried and tested:                 7100
11684: It was often censured, but more often praised:
11685: One grips maidens, money, gold,
11686: To the gripper, Fortune’s never cold.
11687: Giant Ants
11688: 
11689: You spoke of gold: we’ve collected lots of it,
11690: In rocks and caves, secretly, we’ve crammed it:                     7105
11691: The Arimaspi, discovered it all, one day,
11692: They’re laughing now: they took it far away.
11693: 
11694: The Gryphon
11695: 
11696: We’ll soon make them confess.
11697: 
11698: The Arimaspi (For the Scythian race of the Arimaspi and their association
11699: with gold mining see Herodotus’ Histories)
11700: 
11701: But not on this night of public festival.
11702: By morning we’ll have spent it all.                                 7110
11703: This time at least we’ll achieve success.
11704: 
11705: Mephistopheles (Sitting among the Sphinxes.)
11706: 
11707: How free, and easy, I feel here,
11708: I understand you, one and all.
11709: 
11710: Sphinx
11711: 
11712: We breathe out spirit-tones, clear,
11713: That for you become substantial.                                    7115
11714: Now name yourself, so we can know your fame.
11715: 
11716: Mephistopheles
11717: 
11718: Men choose to saddle me with a host of names…
11719: Are there Britons here? They travel about so much,
11720: Looking for battlefields, and ruined walls,
11721: The dullest classical places, waterfalls:                           7120
11722: Here’s a site that’s worth all their fuss.
11723: They spoke of me too: in their Mysteries:
11724: And portrayed me there as Old Iniquity.
11725: A Sphinx
11726: 
11727: How so?
11728: 
11729: Mephistopheles
11730: 
11731:       I don’t know why that should be.
11732: 
11733: A Sphinx
11734: 
11735: Perhaps you’ve knowledge of the stars?                7125
11736: What do you think of the present hour?
11737: 
11738: Mephistopheles (Gazing upwards.)
11739: 
11740: Star glides by star, the horned moon shines bright,
11741: And I feel happy here, in this mournful site,
11742: I warm myself on a lion skin: your right.
11743: To have to take off, again: that would be hard:       7130
11744: Give us a riddle, or at least charades.
11745: 
11746: Sphinx
11747: 
11748: To express yourself, that would be a riddle.
11749: Try for once to solve your own inner muddle:
11750: ‘Needed by the good man and the sinful,
11751: To the first a breastplate in ascetic swordplay,      7135
11752: A wild friend for the other, to show the way,
11753: And both amusing Zeus with their display.’
11754: 
11755: The First Gryphon (Snarling.)
11756: 
11757: I don’t like him!
11758: 
11759: The Second Gryphon (Snarling more fiercely.)
11760: 
11761:                           What’s he after?
11762: 
11763: Both Gryphons
11764: The nasty thing, he’s not been heard of here!
11765: 
11766: Mephistopheles (Nastily)
11767: 
11768: Perhaps you think a guest’s nails can’t claw          7140
11769: Every bit as sharply as those talons of yours?
11770: Just try it, then!
11771: 
11772: A Sphinx (Gently.)
11773: 
11774:                         You’ll only stay until,
11775: You leave our company, yourself, as you will:
11776: In your own land everything worked for you,
11777: But this if I’m not wrong’s too much for you.         7145
11778: 
11779: Mephistopheles
11780: 
11781: Looked at above, you’re rather appetising,
11782: But lower down the creature’s somewhat frightening.
11783: 
11784: A Sphinx
11785: 
11786: False one, you’ll do bitter penance,
11787: These claws of ours are sound and good:
11788: You with your withered horse’s hoof,                  7150
11789: Aren’t comfortable in our presence.
11790: 
11791: (The Sirens start to sing, above them.)
11792: 
11793: What are those birds shaking
11794: The poplar branches by the stream?
11795: 
11796: A Sphinx
11797: 
11798: Take care! The song they’re making
11799: Conquered the best there’s ever been.                 7155
11800: The Sirens
11801: 
11802: Ah, why should you choose to live
11803: Amongst amazing ugliness!
11804: Listen, we flock to you, ah yes,
11805: With tuneful sounds, in excess,
11806: That Sirens ought to give.              7160
11807: 
11808: The Sphinxes (Mocking them.)
11809: 
11810: Make them fly down here to us!
11811: Their falcon-claws, so hideous,
11812: They’ve hidden in the leaves:
11813: They’ll fall on you, cruelly, you see
11814: If you choose to hear them sigh.        7165
11815: 
11816: The Sirens
11817: 
11818: Away with hate! Away with envy!
11819: We gather purest ecstasies,
11820: Scattered through the sky!
11821: On the earth, or on the sea,
11822: With the happiest gestures, we          7170
11823: Greet men who wander by.
11824: 
11825: Mephistopheles
11826: 
11827: This is news of the sweetest,
11828: Here from lyre and chest,
11829: One note twines round another.
11830: But this warbling’s lost on me:         7175
11831: It crawls into my ear, you see,
11832: Yet my heart feels nothing, here.
11833: 
11834: The Sphinxes
11835: 
11836: Don’t talk of hearts! That’s idle:
11837: A leather bag would do as well,
11838: To match that face you wear.            7180
11839: Faust (Approaching.)
11840: 
11841: Marvellous! Gazing’s enough for me,
11842: At grand repulsiveness, and solidity:
11843: I suspect I’ll find good fortune shortly:
11844: Where will this serious gazing take me?
11845: 
11846: (He points at the Sphinxes.)
11847: 
11848: Once Oedipus stood in front of them:          7185
11849: 
11850: (He points at the Sirens.)
11851: 
11852: Ulysses writhed in ropes for them:
11853: 
11854: (He points to the Ants.)
11855: 
11856: They gathered a mighty treasure.
11857: 
11858: (He points to the Gryphons.)
11859: 
11860: They guarded it in fullest measure.
11861: I feel new power flowing through me:
11862: Mighty these forms: of mighty memory.         7190
11863: 
11864: Mephistopheles
11865: 
11866: Once you’d have run from things like these,
11867: But now they look good to you:
11868: When a man seeks his beloved, he’s
11869: Ready to meet monsters too.
11870: 
11871: Faust (To the Sphinxes.)
11872: 
11873: You female forms, tell me then,               7195
11874: Have any of you seen Helen?
11875: The Sphinxes
11876: 
11877: None of us lasted till her day,
11878: Hercules the last did slay.
11879: You can ask Chiron, anyway:
11880: He gallops round in this spirit night:        7200
11881: When he stops for you, you might.
11882: 
11883: The Sirens
11884: 
11885: You will not fail at all!…
11886: How Ulysses lingered with us,
11887: Not hurrying scornfully by us,
11888: He’d many times recall:                       7205
11889: All will be shown you,
11890: If you make your journey to
11891: Our fields, in the green sea.
11892: 
11893: A Sphinx
11894: 
11895: Don’t let yourself be deceived.
11896: Instead of Ulysses self-bonded,               7210
11897: We bind with good advice. On!
11898: When you reach noble Chiron,
11899: You’ll find it’s as I promised.
11900: 
11901: (Faust wanders off.)
11902: 
11903: Mephistopheles (In a temper.)
11904: 
11905: What croaks by me on beating wing,
11906: So quick that one can’t see a thing.          7215
11907: And one behind the other, flying?
11908: Even a hunter would weary of these.
11909: 
11910: A Sphinx
11911: 
11912: That storm, like the winds of winter, here,
11913: Hercules’ arrows could scarce get near:
11914: They are the swift Stymphalides,              7220
11915: And their croaked greetings are well-meant,
11916: The vulture-beaked, and goose-webbed.
11917: They’d gladly appear in our place,
11918: As a closely-related race.
11919: 
11920: Mephistopheles (As if intimidated.)
11921: 
11922: Something else is having a hissing fit.        7225
11923: 
11924: Sphinx
11925: 
11926: Don’t be worried about those either!
11927: They’re the heads of the Lernaean Hydra,
11928: Lopped from the trunk, but think they’re it.
11929: But, what’s the matter, now then?
11930: Why all the restless movements?                7230
11931: Where are you going? He’s gone!…
11932: I see that Chorus over there, that one,
11933: Has turned your head. You’ll get nowhere,
11934: Go on: greet every sweet face there!
11935: They’re Lamiae, the lustful girls,             7235
11936: With smiling lips, impudent curls,
11937: The race of Satyrs all delight in:
11938: With them a cloven foot’s the very thing.
11939: 
11940: Mephistopheles
11941: 
11942: Will you stay here? So I can find you again.
11943: 
11944: Sphinx
11945: 
11946: Yes! Mix with the flighty rabble.              7240
11947: In Egypt, we were accustomed, you know,
11948: To rule for a thousand years or so.
11949: And if you respect our location,
11950: We’ll regulate the days of Moon and Sun.
11951: We’ll sit in front of the Pyramids,            7245
11952: To pass judgement on the nations:
11953: With changeless faces, there, amid
11954: War and peace, and inundations.
11955: (On the Lower Peneus.)
11956: 
11957: (The river-god, surrounded by nymphs and tributary streams.)
11958: 
11959: Peneus
11960: 
11961: Stir, you reed-beds, whispering, flowing!
11962: Sigh softly, slender rushes, bowing,                           7250
11963: Lightly, willow-bushes, rustling,
11964: Lisp, you poplar-branches trembling,
11965: Through the broken dream!…..
11966: Dreadful premonitions wake me,
11967: Secret quivering, now, shakes me,                              7255
11968: In my peaceful wandering stream.
11969: 
11970: Faust (Approaching the river.)
11971: 
11972: If I heard true, as I believe:
11973: From behind the tangled leaves
11974: Of these shrubs and branches,
11975: Came sounds of human voices.                                   7260
11976: Then the fount seemed to chatter,
11977: And the breeze filled with laughter.
11978: 
11979: The Nymphs (To Faust.)
11980: 
11981: Just to lie here, now,
11982: For you would be best,
11983: Reviving your wearied                                          7265
11984: Body with coolness,
11985: Enjoy here forever
11986: Your fugitive rest:
11987: Murmuring, trickling,
11988: We’ll whisper, and bless.                                      7270
11989: Faust
11990: 
11991: I’m awake! O let them linger there
11992: Those images without compare,
11993: As they reached my sight.
11994: I’m moved so marvellously!
11995: Is it dream? Or is it memory?               7275
11996: Once before, I knew this delight.
11997: The waters creep through the freshness,
11998: The softly swaying bushes’ thickness,
11999: Without rushing, barely trickling:
12000: A hundred founts from all sides press,      7280
12001: And gather to the purest brightness,
12002: Fill the pool’s shallow ring.
12003: Glowing limbs of young girls are
12004: Reflected by the liquid mirror,
12005: And added to the eye’s delight!             7285
12006: Companionably, bathing joyfully,
12007: Swimming boldly, wading shyly,
12008: Crying out, at last, in watery fight.
12009: This sight’s enough to renew
12010: My eyes with gazing at the view,            7290
12011: But ever wider vision strains.
12012: My glance cuts sharply through the cover,
12013: Rich foliage, green wealth, around her,
12014: Serves to hide the noble queen.
12015: 
12016: Marvellous! The swans approaching:          7295
12017: From the bays, come softly swimming,
12018: Majestically pure their movement.
12019: Floating calm, in sweet society,
12020: But how proudly, self-delightedly,
12021: Head and neck are lifted, bent…..           7300
12022: One shines out above all others,
12023: Boasting boldly of his favours,
12024: Sailing swiftly in their race:
12025: His ruffled plumage swelling,
12026: Wave-like, on the wave he’s stirring,       7305
12027: He hastens to the sacred place…
12028: The others swimming here and there,
12029: With their smooth shining feathers,
12030: Soon meet in fine contention,
12031: Drive away the frightened maidens,         7310
12032: Not thinking of their service, then
12033: But only of their own protection.
12034: 
12035: The Nymphs
12036: 
12037: Sisters, bend and set you ears
12038: To the river-banks’ green turf:
12039: If I hear rightly, coming near,            7315
12040: That’s the sound of hooves on earth.
12041: If I only knew who that message might
12042: Be bringing, swiftly, to the Night!
12043: 
12044: Faust
12045: 
12046: To me, the ground seems ringing, too
12047: Echoing to some swift stallion’s hoof.     7320
12048: There, gaze, my eyes!
12049: Good luck, is nigh,
12050: Will it come to me as well?
12051: O, wonder without parallel!
12052: A rider trots towards us, now,             7325
12053: Gifted, shines with spirit and power
12054: Grafted to a snow-white horse…
12055: I know him too, I can’t be wrong,
12056: It’s Philyra’s famous son! –
12057: Halt, Chiron! Halt! Hear my discourse…     7330
12058: 
12059: Chiron (The Centaur.)
12060: 
12061: What then? What is it?
12062: 
12063: Faust
12064: 
12065:                          Delay a moment!
12066: Chiron
12067: 
12068: I never rest.
12069: 
12070: Faust
12071:                 Well, take me with you, then!
12072: 
12073: Chiron
12074: 
12075: Mount! And I can question you, at leisure:
12076: Where are you going? You’re by the river,
12077: I’ll carry you through the flood, with pleasure.   7335
12078: 
12079: Faust (Mounting his back.)
12080: 
12081: Wherever you wish. My thanks forever…
12082: You, the great man, the noble teacher,
12083: Famed for educating the race of heroes,
12084: That splendid company of the Argonauts,
12085: And all who edified the Poets’ thoughts.           7340
12086: 
12087: Chiron
12088: 
12089: All that in its proper place!
12090: As Mentor, even Pallas wasn’t rated:
12091: In the end they do things their own way,
12092: As if they’d none of them been educated.
12093: 
12094: Faust
12095: 
12096: The doctor who can name the plants,                7345
12097: And roots, profoundly, understands:
12098: Who heals the sick, and soothes the wound,
12099: Here, strong in mind and body, have I found!
12100: Chiron
12101: 
12102: When a hero was injured near me.
12103: I gave the right assistance and advice:       7350
12104: But, at last, bequeathed my art, you see,
12105: To priests, and herb-gathering old wives.
12106: 
12107: Faust
12108: 
12109: You’ve a truly great man’s ways:
12110: He won’t hear a word of praise.
12111: He’ll modestly defer to us                    7355
12112: And act as if all were equals.
12113: 
12114: Chiron
12115: 
12116: You seem artful at those pretences,
12117: Which flatter common folk and princes.
12118: 
12119: Faust
12120: 
12121: But surely you’d confess today:
12122: You saw the greatest, of your age,            7360
12123: Among the noblest deeds, you trod,
12124: And lived life as a demi-god.
12125: Among those great heroic forms,
12126: Who was the finest of them all?
12127: 
12128: Chiron
12129: 
12130: Among the Argonauts, in my day,               7365
12131: Each was worthy, in his own way.
12132: And with the powers he inhaled,
12133: Knew enough when others failed.
12134: Castor and Pollux always conquered,
12135: When youth and beauty were honoured.          7370
12136: In determination, and swift help to others,
12137: First was Calais, and Zetes his brother,
12138: Thoughtful, clever, strong, well-advised,
12139: Jason conquered, woman-folk’s delight.
12140: Then Orpheus: gentle, always brooding,            7375
12141: Sounding the lyre, quite over-powering.
12142: Sharp-eyed Lynceus, by night and day,
12143: Steering the sacred ship past reef and bay…
12144: Let such dangers always be faced as brothers:
12145: If one achieves he’s praised by all the others.   7380
12146: 
12147: Faust
12148: 
12149: Of Hercules, you say nothing?
12150: 
12151: Chiron
12152: 
12153: Oh! Don’t rouse my yearning….
12154: Never noting how Phoebus
12155: Ares, or Hermes, were defined,
12156: With my own eyes I saw before us                  7385
12157: What all men praise as divine.
12158: He was born a king, no other,
12159: A splendid youth to gaze upon:
12160: Yielding to his elder brother,
12161: And the loveliest of women.                       7390
12162: Gaea’s never known a second,
12163: Nor Hebe led such on to heaven’s zone:
12164: In vain for him they sing the songs,
12165: In vain for him they carve the stone.
12166: 
12167: Faust
12168: 
12169: The sculptors never caught his form,              7395
12170: However many images they made.
12171: You’ve spoken of the loveliest man,
12172: Now speak about the loveliest maid!
12173: Chiron
12174: 
12175: What!…I won’t talk of woman’s beauty,
12176: It’s so often a frozen mask to me:                   7400
12177: I can only praise that nature, truly,
12178: Flowing freely, and cheerfully.
12179: Beauty’s delighted with itself:
12180: Grace makes it irresistible,
12181: Like Helen, whom I carried.                          7405
12182: 
12183: Faust
12184: 
12185: You carried her?
12186: 
12187: Chiron
12188: 
12189:                 Yes on this very back.
12190: 
12191: Faust
12192: 
12193: Was I not sufficiently aroused?
12194: Such a seat, now, will bring me luck!
12195: 
12196: Chiron
12197: 
12198: She gripped me by the mane, so,
12199: As you are doing.
12200: 
12201: Faust
12202: 
12203:              I’m vanquished, oh,                     7410
12204: Completely! Tell me, why here?
12205: She is my one and only desire!
12206: Carried her from where, to where?
12207: 
12208: Chiron
12209: 
12210: That’s easy to tell, since you enquire.
12211: At that time, the Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux,       7415
12212: Freed their sister, Helen, from a nest of robbers.
12213: The robbers then, not used to being conquered,
12214: Regained their courage, and chased them onward.
12215: The sister and brothers’ hasty course was halted
12216: By all the swamps that lie below Eleusis:          7420
12217: The brothers waded: I swam over, swiftly:
12218: Then she sprang off, and, stroking gently
12219: My wet mane, caressed me, thanked me,
12220: Confident, sweetly clever were her ways.
12221: She was so charming! Youth, delighting Age!        7425
12222: 
12223: Faust
12224: 
12225: Only ten years old!…
12226: 
12227: Chiron
12228: 
12229:           The philologists deceive you,
12230: I see, while deceiving themselves too.
12231: It’s strange that with a mythological woman,
12232: Poets use her, at will, to draw our attention,
12233: She can never age, is never old,                   7430
12234: Cast in the same enticing mould,
12235: Seduced when young, in age delights:
12236: Enough, no age restricts a poet’s flights.
12237: 
12238: Faust
12239: 
12240: Then let her be as if no age has bound her!
12241: As Achilles on Pherae once found her,              7435
12242: Beyond all ages. What rare luck:
12243: In spite of every fate, to win her love!
12244: And shall I, by the strength of my yearning,
12245: Not draw that unique form towards me, living,
12246: That eternal being, equal to the divine,           7440
12247: Great yet tender: kind as she’s sublime.
12248: You saw her once: today I too have seen her,
12249: Lovely in her attraction: as lovely as desired.
12250: Now my soul and being is strongly tied:
12251: If I can’t win her, I shan’t survive.              7445
12252: Chiron
12253: 
12254: Ah, stranger! You’re enraptured like Mankind:
12255: Among us Spirits you seem maddened, blind.
12256: Yet now your fate is to be met with here:
12257: Though only for a moment, every year,
12258: I take the time to call on Manto, there,              7450
12259: Aesculapius’ daughter: in silent prayer
12260: Imploring her father to add to his fame,
12261: Enlighten, at last, each rash doctor’s brain,
12262: And persuade them never to deal death again…
12263: I like her best of all the crowd of Sibyls,           7455
12264: Free of grimaces, kind and generous:
12265: If you stay with her, she’s the power too,
12266: To heal you totally: with herbs and roots.
12267: 
12268: Faust
12269: 
12270: I don’t need healing: my mind is filled with power:
12271: There I’d become as base as others are.               7460
12272: 
12273: Chiron
12274: 
12275: Don’t scorn the healing of the noble fount!
12276: We’ve reached the place, so, quick, dismount!
12277: 
12278: Faust
12279: 
12280: Tell me, where, through pebbly water,
12281: In the gloomy night, you’ve brought us?
12282: 
12283: Chiron
12284: 
12285: Here Greece and Rome braved the fight,                7465
12286: Olympus to your left, Peneus on the right,
12287: The greatest empire lost here to the sand:
12288: A king flees: and citizens win the land.
12289: Gaze around! Famous Tempe is nearby,
12290: Eternal, there, under the moonlit sky.                7470
12291: Manto (Inside, dreaming.)
12292: 
12293: Horses’ hooves sound
12294: On sacred ground,
12295: Demi-gods are nigh us.
12296: 
12297: Chiron
12298: 
12299: Quite right!
12300: Just open your eyes!                         7475
12301: 
12302: Manto (Waking.)
12303: 
12304: Welcome! I see you don’t keep away.
12305: 
12306: Chiron
12307: 
12308: And your temple’s still here to stay!
12309: 
12310: Manto
12311: 
12312: You still gallop round, untiringly?
12313: 
12314: Chiron
12315: 
12316: And you, as ever, sit peacefully,
12317: While I enjoy circling round.                7480
12318: 
12319: Manto
12320: 
12321: I wait, and Time circles me I’ve found.
12322: And him?
12323: 
12324: Chiron
12325: 
12326:          The shadowy night
12327: Has whirled him to our sight.
12328: Helen he wants to win,
12329: Helen’s maddening him.                       7485
12330: And he doesn’t know where or how to begin:
12331: Above all he deserves the Aesculapian healing.
12332: 
12333: Manto
12334: 
12335: I like the ones who want impossible things.
12336: 
12337: (Chiron is already far off.)
12338: 
12339: Rash man, advance, here’s joy for you!
12340: This dark path leads to Persephone too.          7490
12341: Under Olympus’ hollow foot, stealing,
12342: She listens for secret, forbidden greeting.
12343: I smuggled Orpheus down here once before:
12344: Use your chance better! Quick! Be sure!
12345: 
12346: (They descend.)
12347: Part II Act II Scene IV: On The Upper Peneus Again
12348: 
12349: The Sirens
12350: 
12351: Plunge now in Peneus’ flood!                         7495
12352: Here you can delight in swimming,
12353: Song on song too, harmonising,
12354: Does unlucky people good.
12355: There’s no healing without water!
12356: With the shining crowd run we                        7500
12357: Quick, to the Aegean Sea,
12358: Where every joy’s on offer.
12359: 
12360: (An Earthquake.)
12361: 
12362: The foaming wave sweeps wider,
12363: Flowing in its bed no longer:
12364: Earth shakes and waters roar,                        7505
12365: Stony banks split once more.
12366: We fly on! Come, one and all!
12367: We’ll not profit from this at all.
12368: On! Each noble, happy guest,
12369: To the ocean’s cheerful zest,                        7510
12370: Gleaming, where the trembling waves
12371: Lightly heaving, wash the bays:
12372: Where the moon’s reflected light,
12373: Wets with heaven’s dew, at night.
12374: There, a freely flowing life,                        7515
12375: Here, an earthquake’s fearful strife:
12376: Every clever one, hasten on!
12377: This place is a hideous one.
12378: Seismos (Growling and jolting in the deep.)
12379: 
12380: Push again, with power,
12381: With your shoulders, tower!                   7520
12382: So the world above is ours,
12383: Where all must yield to us.
12384: 
12385: The Sphinxes
12386: 
12387: What a horrid shuddering,
12388: Ugly, hideous juddering!
12389: What a quivering and swaying,                 7525
12390: Back and forwards, playing!
12391: What an intolerable fuss!
12392: But we’ll not lose our place,
12393: Even if all hell shakes.
12394: Now a dome is lifted,                         7530
12395: Wonderful. He’s gifted
12396: It to us, the ancient one,
12397: Delos’ isle was his creation,
12398: Driven from out the wave,
12399: To bring Latona aid.                          7535
12400: He with striving, pushing, pressing,
12401: Arms straight, and shoulders bending,
12402: Like an Atlas in his action,
12403: Lifts rock and earth, in motion,
12404: Shingle, gravel, sand: the floors             7540
12405: All along our peaceful shores.
12406: Rips our vale’s quiet surface up,
12407: Crosswise, with a single cut:
12408: Fiercely, and unwearied,
12409: A colossal caryatid,                          7545
12410: Bears a fearsome weight of boulders,
12411: Still buried, downwards to his shoulders:
12412: But he’ll come no further, now,
12413: The Sphinxes’ place is here, we vow.
12414: Seismos
12415: 
12416: I myself achieved all this,                7550
12417: Man should admit it, finally:
12418: If I’d not jolted and shaken it,
12419: How could the world be so lovely? –
12420: How could your peaks stand so high,
12421: In the pure and splendid blue,             7555
12422: If I’d not pushed them to the sky,
12423: Picturesque and charming too?
12424: Then, thinking of my high ancestry,
12425: Night and Chaos, I behaved badly,
12426: And, a company of Titans, we               7560
12427: With Pelion and Ossa played madly,
12428: Romping round in youthful glee,
12429: Till, we tired of it, at last,
12430: And set both mountains, wickedly,
12431: On Parnassus, as a double hat….            7565
12432: There, now, Apollo’s sweet retreat,
12433: With the happy band of Muses.
12434: And Jupiter, thunderbolts complete:
12435: I even raised the high seat he uses.
12436: So now with monstrous striving             7570
12437: I’ve pushed this upwards, from the deep,
12438: And call, aloud, to their new being,
12439: The joyful dwellers of the steep.
12440: 
12441: The Sphinxes
12442: 
12443: One would think long ago,
12444: This was lifted to the sky,                7575
12445: Had we not seen from down below,
12446: How it wormed its way on high.
12447: A bushy forest covers it,
12448: And rock on rock is piled around:
12449: Sphinxes don’t care about it,              7580
12450: It won’t disturb our sacred ground.
12451: The Gryphons
12452: 
12453: Gold in leaves, and gold in spangles,
12454: Through the cracks, see, it tremble.
12455: Don’t you rob us of our treasure,
12456: Ants, come, gather it together!         7585
12457: 
12458: Chorus of Ants
12459: 
12460: As this the giant ones
12461: Threw to the sky,
12462: You restless-footed ones,
12463: Quick, climb it on high!
12464: Rapidly in and out!                     7590
12465: In cracks like these,
12466: Every crumb about’s
12467: Worth you can seize.
12468: You must uncover
12469: Even the slightest,                     7595
12470: In every corner
12471: Quick as the brightest.
12472: You must be everywhere,
12473: Swarming around: then,
12474: Only bring gold here!                   7600
12475: Forget the mountain.
12476: 
12477: The Gryphons
12478: 
12479: Come! Come! Heap the gold!
12480: With our claws, we’ll keep hold:
12481: They are the best locks yet:
12482: Great treasures they protect.           7605
12483: 
12484: The Pygmies (Classical Dwarves.)
12485: 
12486: We’ve acquired some room,
12487: How, it isn’t clear.
12488: Don’t ask where we’re from:
12489: The main thing is we’re here!
12490: Life is cheerfully suited               7610
12491: To every sort of land:
12492: Where a rock is lifted,
12493: Dwarves are there, on hand.
12494: Men and maids, quick and busy,
12495: Exemplary, every pair:              7615
12496: In Paradise, once, maybe,
12497: A similar race lived there.
12498: But the best is here we find,
12499: Thankfully our fate is blessed:
12500: Mother Earth is always kind,        7620
12501: In the East as in the West.
12502: 
12503: The Dactyls (Little Ironworkers.)
12504: 
12505: If she can bring to light
12506: The Little Ones in a night,
12507: The Littlest Ones, she can make
12508: And each will still find a mate.    7625
12509: 
12510: The Pygmy-Elders
12511: 
12512: Hurry: make space:
12513: A convenient place!
12514: Quickly, to work!
12515: Strength, never shirk!
12516: While we’re in peace,               7630
12517: Our smithy increase,
12518: To furnish the horde
12519: With armour and sword.
12520: All you ant-forms,
12521: Moving in swarms,                   7635
12522: Bring us the ore!
12523: And all you Dactyls,
12524: So many, so little,
12525: You are commanded
12526: To bring us the wood!               7640
12527: Heap it up higher,
12528: Secretive fire,
12529: Fetch coals as you should.
12530: The Pygmy Generalissimo
12531: 
12532: Look lively, though,
12533: With arrow and bow!                      7645
12534: Shoot me the herons
12535: Out in the ponds,
12536: Countless they’re nests,
12537: Proud are their breasts,
12538: Shoot them, together,                    7650
12539: All in one blow!
12540: So we can show
12541: Helmets with feathers.
12542: 
12543: Ants and Dactyls
12544: 
12545: Who now can save us!
12546: We bring the iron                        7655
12547: They forge the fetters.
12548: It won’t be soon
12549: This thing will end,
12550: Meanwhile we bend.
12551: 
12552: The Cranes of Ibycus
12553: 
12554: Cries of murdered, calls of dying!       7660
12555: Fearful fluttering and flying!
12556: Such deep moans, and such groans
12557: Carry to our airy zones!
12558: All already slaughtered,
12559: Blood is reddening the water,            7665
12560: Misshapen dwarfish passions,
12561: Steal the herons’ noblest gems.
12562: Now they’re waving on their helmets:
12563: Those fat-bellied bow-legged serpents.
12564: You our armies’ members,                 7670
12565: Files of ocean-wanderers,
12566: You we call to vengeance,
12567: To kin-related business.
12568: No one spare his strength or blood!
12569: Show hatred always to that brood!        7675
12570: (They disperse, croaking.)
12571: 
12572: Mephistopheles (On the plain.)
12573: 
12574: Northern witches were easily controlled,
12575: But over foreign spirits I’ve no hold.
12576: The Blocksberg’s a most convenient locale,
12577: Wherever you are, you’ll find yourself there still.
12578: Dame Ilse watches for us, from her tall stone,        7680
12579: And Heinrich’s still awake on his high throne,
12580: At Elend, the Snorers snore away,
12581: All’s done for a thousand years and a day.
12582: Who knows here if, where he sits, you see,
12583: The Earth won’t swell up beneath his feet?….          7685
12584: I wander happily through a level valley,
12585: And in a moment there, thrown up behind me,
12586: A mountain, true it’s hardly to be called one,
12587: But high enough to hide the Sphinxes’ home –
12588: Still, the valley breeds many a fire here,            7690
12589: And so illuminates this mad affair….
12590: The magic sparks of that charming chorus.
12591: Still enticing, vanishing, hover near us.
12592: Gently now! All too used to nibbling,
12593: Wherever we are, we find ourselves snatching.         7695
12594: 
12595: The Lamiae (Drawing Mephistopheles after them.)
12596: 
12597: Faster, and faster!
12598: And ever further!
12599: Then hover again,
12600: Chattering, staying.
12601: It’s such a pleasure,                                 7700
12602: To make the old sinner,
12603: Pursue us, at whim,
12604: Doing hard penance.
12605: See, with his lame stance,
12606: He hobbles forwards,                                  7705
12607: He stumbles onwards:
12608: Trailing his leg, mind:
12609: As we flee from him
12610: He follows behind!
12611: 
12612: Mephistopheles (Standing still.)
12613: 
12614: Cursed fate! Cheated every which way!        7710
12615: Since Adam, seduced and led astray!
12616: We grow old, but who grows wise?
12617: Now, I’m tormented to the skies!
12618: We know they’re a wholly useless sex,
12619: With laced-in bodies, and painted looks.     7715
12620: No healthy response at all, at bottom,
12621: Wherever you grip, their limbs are rotten.
12622: We know, we see, we grasp their ways,
12623: But still we dance when woman plays!
12624: 
12625: The Lamiae (Pausing.)
12626: 
12627: Stop! He thinks: pauses: stays too:          7720
12628: Return, then, lest he should escape you!
12629: 
12630: Mephistopheles (Striding forwards.)
12631: 
12632: On, then! And let no indecision
12633: Grip my flesh, some foolish cavil:
12634: Since if there were no witches given,
12635: Who the devil’d want to be a devil!          7725
12636: 
12637: The Lamiae (Very graciously.)
12638: 
12639: We are circling round the hero!
12640: Let love, in his heart, be sure to
12641: Choose one of us for certain though.
12642: 
12643: Mephistopheles
12644: 
12645: True, in this uncertain shimmer,
12646: You seem pretty girls together,              7730
12647: I’d like not to scorn you so.
12648: Empusa (The demon. Pressing forward.)
12649: 
12650: Nor me! I’m the very thing,
12651: Let me join your following.
12652: 
12653: The Lamiae
12654: 
12655: She’s one too many in our crowd,
12656: She’ll spoil our game if she’s allowed.     7735
12657: 
12658: Empusa (To Mephistopheles.)
12659: 
12660: Greetings from Empusa, to you,
12661: Your cousin, with the ass’s hoof!
12662: You’ve only a horse’s hoof, it’s true,
12663: Yet, cousin, all the best to you!
12664: 
12665: Mephistopheles
12666: 
12667: I thought there were only strangers here,   7740
12668: Sadly, now, relatives appear:
12669: It’s the old story: in their dozens,
12670: From Hartz to Hellas, always cousins!
12671: 
12672: Empusa
12673: 
12674: I act quickly with decision,
12675: I can alter to your vision:                 7745
12676: But to honour you today
12677: My ass’s head I display.
12678: 
12679: Mephistopheles
12680: 
12681: I see great things are signified,
12682: By the relationship implied:
12683: Be that as it may, yet I,                   7750
12684: The ass’s head will still deny.
12685: The Lamiae
12686: 
12687: That ugly thing gives the frights,
12688: To all that’s lovely and delights:
12689: The lovely and delightful before,
12690: When she arrives, are so no more!         7755
12691: 
12692: Mephistopheles
12693: 
12694: These cousins too, so soft and slender,
12695: Are all suspicious, all that gender:
12696: And beneath their cheeks, those roses,
12697: There too, I fear, are metamorphoses.
12698: 
12699: The Lamiae
12700: 
12701: Try us then! We’re many.                  7760
12702: Grasp! And if you’re lucky,
12703: Secure the finest prize.
12704: What was all that lusting for?
12705: You’re a miserable suitor,
12706: Strutting, boasting of your size! –       7765
12707: Now he’s mixing with our crowd:
12708: Drop your masks: you’re allowed:
12709: And bare your being to his eyes.
12710: 
12711: Mephistopheles
12712: 
12713: I’ve chosen the loveliest one…
12714: 
12715: (Clasping her.)
12716: 
12717: Oh! What a skinny broom!                  7770
12718: 
12719: (Clasping another.)
12720: 
12721: And this one?…Wizened looks!
12722: The Lamiae
12723: 
12724: You’re worth better? Not in our books.
12725: 
12726: Mephistopheles
12727: 
12728: That little one might suit my plans…
12729: A lizard gliding through my hands!
12730: And snakelike are her slippery tresses.        7775
12731: I try the tall one to compare…
12732: I grip a thyrsus without hair,
12733: A pinecone, for a head, impresses!
12734: What next?….A fat one, see,
12735: Perhaps she’ll enliven me:                     7780
12736: Let’s risk it, then! Here she is!
12737: So puffy, flabby, in the East
12738: There they’d prize her looks, at least…
12739: But, oh! The puff-ball’s split!
12740: 
12741: The Lamiae
12742: 
12743: Scatter widely, swaying, floating,             7785
12744: Surround him in dark flight, like lightning,
12745: The trespassing witch’s son!
12746: Circles, terrifying, winging!
12747: Bat-like in a silent flickering!
12748: He’ll be grateful when we’ve done.             7790
12749: 
12750: Mephistopheles (Shaking himself.)
12751: 
12752: I’m no cleverer it seems, at all:
12753: Here’s absurd, and so’s the north,
12754: Here and there, the spirits tricky,
12755: Poetry and people tacky.
12756: Here too it’s masquerade, I find:              7795
12757: As everywhere, the dance of mind.
12758: I grasped a lovely masked procession,
12759: And caught things from a horror show…
12760: I’d gladly settle for a false impression,
12761: If it would last a little longer, though.      7800
12762: (He loses his way among the rocks.)
12763: 
12764: Where am I now? Where will it wander?
12765: There was a path, now it’s a horror.
12766: I got here by smooth and level ways,
12767: And now the scree prevents escape.
12768: I clamber up and down in vain,                        7805
12769: How shall I find the Sphinx again?
12770: I’ve never known anything like it, quite,
12771: A mountain range in a single night!
12772: I call it a lively witches’ ride,
12773: They’ve brought the Blocksberg, beside.               7810
12774: 
12775: An Oread (A mountain nymph, from the natural rock.)
12776: 
12777: Climb up here! My range is old,
12778: In primeval forms the peaks unfold.
12779: Respect the steep and rocky stair,
12780: Pindus’ last slopes stretch there!
12781: Unshakeable, once I stood, as now,                    7815
12782: When Pompey fled across my brow.
12783: Beside me, illusion’s stones will go,
12784: As soon as ever the cock shall crow.
12785: I often see such fables thrown on high,
12786: And suddenly sink back again and die.                 7820
12787: 
12788: Mephistopheles
12789: 
12790: Honour to you, you noble length,
12791: Garlanded high with oaken strength!
12792: The clearest moonlight never weaves
12793: Through the darkness of your leaves –
12794: I see a light, with parting glow,                     7825
12795: Through the silent bushes go.
12796: How all things come together!
12797: Homunculus it is who’s there!
12798: Which way now, little fellow?
12799: Homunculus
12800: 
12801: I flit about from hill to hollow                7830
12802: And, in the truest sense, I’d gladly ‘be’,
12803: I’m so impatient, now, to smash the glass:
12804: Only, so far, given what I can see,
12805: I wouldn’t want to do it in this pass.
12806: But in confidence I confess I was               7835
12807: On the trail of two philosophers,
12808: All I heard them say was: Nature, Nature!
12809: I’ll not part from them for anything,
12810: They must know about earthly being:
12811: And in the end I’ll find out, too,              7840
12812: The cleverest place to travel to.
12813: 
12814: Mephistopheles
12815: 
12816: Well, do it on your own behalf, here.
12817: Where the spirits all find their place,
12818: The Philosopher can show his face.
12819: To please you with his art and favour,          7845
12820: He’ll make you a dozen, any flavour.
12821: You’ll have no intellect, unless you err.
12822: If you want to ‘be’, make it your own affair!
12823: 
12824: Homunculus
12825: 
12826: Good advice too is not to be disdained.
12827: 
12828: Mephistopheles
12829: 
12830: Then off with you! I’ll look around again.      7850
12831: 
12832: (They part.)
12833: Anaxagoras (To Thales.)
12834: 
12835: The stubborn mind will never ever bend:
12836: What more do you need to be enlightened?
12837: 
12838: Thales
12839: 
12840: The waves will gladly bow to every wind,
12841: Yet far from the jagged cliffs they’ll end.
12842: 
12843: Anaxagoras
12844: 
12845: This cliff came about by fiery vapours.        7855
12846: 
12847: Thales
12848: 
12849: By moisture living things were created.
12850: 
12851: Homunculus (Between the two.)
12852: 
12853: Let me walk beside you, please.
12854: I myself desire to ‘be’!
12855: 
12856: Anaxagoras
12857: 
12858: Have you, O Thales, in a single night
12859: Brought a mount, from mud, to light?           7860
12860: 
12861: Thales
12862: 
12863: Never has nature in her living flow,
12864: Been bound to day, night, and hours, though.
12865: She creates every form by rule,
12866: At her greatest, force is never her tool.
12867: Anaxagoras
12868: 
12869: Here it was! Furious Plutonic fire,                7865
12870: Monstrous Aeolian vapours thrown higher,
12871: Broke through the ancient earth’s smooth crust,
12872: And raised the new mount with a swift up-thrust.
12873: 
12874: Thales
12875: 
12876: What more will come of it?
12877: It’s there, that’s fine: let it sit.               7870
12878: One loses time in remonstrance,
12879: And only leads the patient folk a dance.
12880: 
12881: Anaxagoras
12882: 
12883: The Mount quickly filled with Myrmidons,
12884: Living in the rocky clefts and caverns:
12885: Pygmies, ants and fingerlings,                     7875
12886: And other active little things.
12887: 
12888: (To Homunculus.)
12889: 
12890: You’ve not striven hard for greatness,
12891: Lived hermit-like, in narrowness:
12892: If you can accustom yourself to power,
12893: I’ll crown you their king, in an hour.             7880
12894: 
12895: Homunculus
12896: 
12897: What does Thales say?
12898: 
12899: Thales
12900: 
12901:                    It’s not my recommendation:
12902: With small means, you’ll only do small actions:
12903: With great means, the small achieve great ones.
12904: Look there! A dark cloud, see, the cranes come!
12905: So the excitable crowd will threaten,              7885
12906: And they would threaten the king so.
12907: With sharpened beak, and grasping claw,
12908: They tread the small ones to the floor:
12909: Fate falls like lightning on those below.
12910: It was a crime to kill the herons,                  7890
12911: Caught on their quiet and peaceful ponds.
12912: But that rain of arrowed slaughter,
12913: Brings cruel and bloody vengeance after,
12914: Summons the anger of their kin above,
12915: To spill the Pygmies’ guilty blood.                 7895
12916: What need for helmets, shields and spears?
12917: What use the dwarves’ heron-feather?
12918: How Dactyls and Ants hide together!
12919: The army wavers, flies, and disappears.
12920: 
12921: Anaxagoras (After a moment, solemnly.)
12922: 
12923: Till now I’ve praised the subterranean powers,      7900
12924: But turn, in this case, to higher ones than ours…
12925: You! Above, always evergreen,
12926: Triple-named, triply to be seen,
12927: I cry to you, by my people’s woe,
12928: Diana, Luna, Hecate, so!                            7905
12929: You, in deepest thought, the heartening,
12930: You power profound, calmly shining,
12931: Reveal your dark side’s fearful shower,
12932: Without spells, show your ancient power!
12933: 
12934: (A pause.)
12935: 
12936: Am I heard so swiftly?                              7910
12937: Has my cry
12938: To the deep sky
12939: Stirred Nature’s ranks so quickly?
12940: Already, greater, greater, nearing,
12941: The Goddess’ orbed throne appearing,                7915
12942: Monstrous, fearful to the sight!
12943: With fires that redden in the night…
12944: No closer, threatening disc of power!
12945: You’ll straight destroy us: sea and shore!
12946: So it was true, the Thessalian women,               7920
12947: Trusted with wicked magic runes,
12948: Enchanted you from your circling path,
12949: Wrested evil things from you, in wrath?…
12950: The bright shield now darkens,
12951: Suddenly splits: flashes, sparkles!         7925
12952: What a hissing! What a drumming!
12953: Thunder, wind, and rain are coming! –
12954: Humbled, on the steps of your throne! –
12955: Forgive me! I brought this on, alone.
12956: 
12957: (He throws himself on his face.)
12958: 
12959: Thales
12960: 
12961: What has this man not heard and seen!       7930
12962: I’m not sure what it was that’s been,
12963: I’m not sensitive to it like him, I find.
12964: We’d confess, these are crazy times,
12965: The Moon is quivering quite gently,
12966: In her place, though, just as formerly.     7935
12967: 
12968: Homunculus
12969: 
12970: Look there, at the Pygmies seat!
12971: The mount was round, now it’s a peak.
12972: I felt the monstrous recoil’s thunder,
12973: A rock fell from the Moon up yonder:
12974: All alike, without asking too,              7940
12975: Friend and foe it squashed and slew.
12976: I have to praise powers like those,
12977: All creation in a single night,
12978: Alike up there as down below,
12979: Bringing a mountain-heap to light.          7945
12980: Thales
12981: 
12982: Peace! It was just an imaginary sight.
12983: So farewell to that ugly brood!
12984: You didn’t become king, that’s good.
12985: Off now to the sea-festival, joy-blessed,
12986: Where they’ll honour a marvellous guest.          7950
12987: 
12988: (They exit.)
12989: 
12990: Mephistopheles (Climbing up the opposite side.)
12991: 
12992: I’ll have to climb through these steep rocks,
12993: Through the roots of ancient oaks!
12994: In my Hartz range, the smell of resin
12995: Has a hint of pitch, almost as pleasant
12996: As sulphur…but here, among the Greeks,            7955
12997: There’s not a sniff, wherever one seeks:
12998: But I’m still rather curious to know
12999: How they make hellfire and brimstone glow.
13000: 
13001: A Dryad (A wood nymph.)
13002: 
13003: In your own land, you’re naturally adept,
13004: Abroad, you don’t know enough as yet.             7960
13005: You shouldn’t think about home, here
13006: With these ancient oak trees to revere.
13007: 
13008: Mephistopheles
13009: 
13010: One thinks of all one’s left: besides,
13011: What one’s used to is paradise.
13012: But tell me what’s in that cave                   7965
13013: Dimly crouching, a triple shape?
13014: 
13015: The Dryad
13016: 
13017: Daughters of Phorkyas! Enter the place,
13018: And speak to them, if you’re not afraid.
13019: Mephistopheles
13020: 
13021: Why not! – I’ll look, and I’m amazed!
13022: Proud as I am, I must confess, though,               7970
13023: I’ve never seen the likes of those,
13024: They’re as foul as Ugliness any day….
13025: How can one find deadly sin
13026: Ugly at all when one has seen
13027: This triple monstrosity?                             7975
13028: We wouldn’t let them cross the sill
13029: Of the worst chamber of our hell.
13030: But here, in the land of beauty, all things Greek,
13031: Are famous now because they’re so antique…
13032: They seem to scent my presence: stirring,            7980
13033: Like vampire bats, squeaking, twittering.
13034: 
13035: The Phorkyads (The Three Graeae)
13036: 
13037: Give me the eye, Sisters, so I can find
13038: Who’s wandering so near our shrine.
13039: 
13040: Mephistopheles
13041: 
13042: Most Revered! Allow me near,
13043: To receive a triple blessing here.                   7985
13044: I come, as yet unknown it’s true,
13045: But distantly related, I think, to you.
13046: I’ve already seen the elder gods,
13047: Bowed low before Rhea and Ops:
13048: I even saw the Fates, your sisters,                  7990
13049: Yesterday, or the day before:
13050: But I’ve never seen the likes of you.
13051: I’m silenced now, and delighted too.
13052: 
13053: The Phorkyads
13054: 
13055: This spirit seems to have some sense.
13056: Mephistopheles
13057: 
13058: I’m amazed no poet’s had the intelligence             7995
13059: To sing of you. Tell me, how can that be?
13060: I’ve never seen you properly painted:
13061: The chisel should only try to carve you,
13062: Not the likes of Pallas, Venus, Juno.
13063: 
13064: The Phorkyads
13065: 
13066: Deep in solitude and stillest night,                  8000
13067: No one ever thought to show us three aright.
13068: 
13069: Mephistopheles
13070: 
13071: How could they? Here, concealed from view.
13072: You can’t see anyone: and they can’t see you.
13073: You need to achieve a suitable place,
13074: Where art and splendour share the space,              8005
13075: Where every day, as walking, living heroes,
13076: With giant steps, each block of marble goes.
13077: Where –
13078: 
13079: The Phorkyads
13080: 
13081:          Be silent, and don’t tempt us to roam!
13082: What use would it be to us, to be better known?
13083: Born in the night, and related to the night,          8010
13084: To ourselves, almost: to others quite out of sight.
13085: 
13086: Mephistopheles
13087: 
13088: In that case, there’s little more to say:
13089: One can oneself to others still betray.
13090: One eye’s enough for three, one tooth as well:
13091: Then it should be mythically possible,                8015
13092: To contain three beings in two,
13093: And leave me the third form, too.
13094: For a little while.
13095: A Phorkyad
13096: 
13097:       What do you think? Shall we try?
13098: 
13099: The Others
13100: 
13101: Let’s! – But without the tooth and eye.
13102: 
13103: Mephistopheles
13104: 
13105: Now you’ve denied me the best features of all:   8020
13106: How can I show your strict and perfect form?
13107: 
13108: A Phorkyad
13109: 
13110: Shut one eye, that’s easy to do,
13111: Let one greedy tooth show too,
13112: In profile you’ll at once achieve
13113: A sisterly likeness, to deceive.                 8025
13114: 
13115: Mephistopheles
13116: 
13117: Many thanks! Done!
13118: 
13119: The Phorkyads
13120: 
13121:                    Done!
13122: 
13123: Mephistopheles (As a Phorkyad, in profile.)
13124: 
13125:             Already I’m one,
13126: Of Chaos’s well-beloved sons!
13127: 
13128: The Phorkyads
13129: 
13130: We’re Chaos’s daughters, of undisputed right.
13131: 
13132: Mephistopheles
13133: 
13134: O shame, now I’ll be called a hermaphrodite.
13135: The Phorkyads
13136: 
13137: What a beauty in our sisterly trio!         8030
13138: We’ve two eyes, and two teeth now.
13139: 
13140: Mephistopheles
13141: 
13142: I’ll hide myself from every eye, as well,
13143: And frighten devils in the lakes of Hell.
13144: 
13145: (He exits.)
13146: Part II Act II Scene V: Rocky Coves in the Aegean Sea
13147: 
13148: (The Moon, lingering, at the zenith.)
13149: 
13150: The Sirens (Lying on the cliffs round about, playing flutes and singing.)
13151: 
13152: Though the Thessalian witch-women
13153: Wickedly, dragged you down to them,                                    8035
13154: With their horrors, long ago, in the dark,
13155: Look quietly down, now, from the arc
13156: Of night, on waves of glittering sparks:
13157: Mildly flashing, bright crowds, these:
13158: Shine now upon the swelling seas,                                      8040
13159: Which raise themselves from the deep!
13160: We’re sworn to serve you, thus,
13161: Sweet Luna, show grace to us.
13162: 
13163: The Nereids and Tritons (As marvels of the deep.)
13164: 
13165: Sound out loud, with clearer tones,
13166: Ringing through the sea’s wide zones:                                  8045
13167: Call the peoples of the deep!
13168: Before the storm’s ravening face,
13169: We sank to the stillest place,
13170: Now we’re drawn, by singing, sweet.
13171: See, how we’ve adorned ourselves,                                      8050
13172: In our great delight, as well,
13173: With our crowns, so nobly gemmed,
13174: And our belts with spangles hemmed!
13175: These spoils, now, before you, we lay,
13176: Treasures, shipwrecked here, and swallowed,                            8055
13177: Your enticing songs they followed,
13178: You the daemons of our bay.
13179: 
13180: The Sirens
13181: 
13182: We know well, in ocean freshness,
13183: Fishes play in slippery smoothness,
13184: Flickering lives, devoid of pain:                                      8060
13185: Yet you festive crowds that stray
13186: We would rather find today,
13187: That you’re more than fish, again.
13188: 
13189: The Nereids and Tritons
13190: 
13191: Before we came to meet you,
13192: We were thinking of that too:                 8065
13193: Speed away now, sisters: brothers!
13194: It only needs the slightest journey,
13195: For most effective proof that we,
13196: Certainly, are more than fishes.
13197: 
13198: (They swim off.)
13199: 
13200: The Sirens
13201: 
13202: They’ve vanished in a moment!                 8070
13203: To Samothrace they’re bent,
13204: Gone, with a favourable breeze.
13205: What is it they think they’ll see,
13206: In the realm of the noble Cabiri?
13207: They’re gods! But wondrously strange,         8075
13208: Always causing their forms to change,
13209: Never knowing what they might be.
13210: Stay at your clear height,
13211: Sweet Luna, graceful light,
13212: So we’ll remain nocturnal,                    8080
13213: Not chased by the diurnal!
13214: 
13215: Thales (On the shore, to Homunculus.)
13216: 
13217: I’d gladly lead you to old Nereus:
13218: His home’s not far away and cavernous,
13219: But his head, it’s of the very stubbornest,
13220: He’s a sour-top, and quite the nastiest.      8085
13221: The whole human race can’t satisfy
13222: Him, the grumbler, and needn’t try.
13223: Yet to him the future is revealed,
13224: And so all show respect, and yield
13225: Him honour in his high position:              8090
13226: He’s done quite well by many a one.
13227: 
13228: Homunculus
13229: 
13230: Then let’s try him, and hurry on!
13231: My glass and flame won’t fail our mission.
13232: 
13233: Nereus (The sea-god.)
13234: 
13235: Are those human voices, in my ear?
13236: How quickly my deepest anger stirs!                 8095
13237: Forms, reaching for the gods, in their endeavour,
13238: Yet condemned to be themselves, forever.
13239: In ancient times I had heavenly rest,
13240: Yet drove myself to act well to the best:
13241: And then, when I’d finished what I’d done,          8100
13242: It was quite clear that nothing had been won.
13243: 
13244: Thales
13245: 
13246: And yet, Old Man of the Sea, we trust you:
13247: You’re the Wise: so don’t drive us from you!
13248: See this flame, he’s almost human, really,
13249: He yields himself to your advice, completely.       8105
13250: 
13251: Nereus
13252: 
13253: What advice! Has Mankind valued my advice?
13254: A wise word’s frozen in a stubborn ear.
13255: No matter how often some harsh action strikes,
13256: People remain as self-willed as before.
13257: I warned Paris himself, in a fatherly way,          8110
13258: Before the foreign girl tempted him to stray.
13259: He stood bravely on the shore of Greece,
13260: And I told him what my Spirit could see:
13261: The smoke-filled air, the streaming blood,
13262: Glowing timbers, slaughter’s flood,                 8115
13263: Troy’s day of judgement, caught in verse,
13264: Its horrors known for ten thousand years.
13265: The old man’s words seemed idle to the young,
13266: He followed his need, and Ilium was gone –
13267: A bloody corpse, frozen with ancient pain,           8120
13268: For Pindus’ eagles, a literary gain.
13269: Ulysses too! Didn’t I tell him about
13270: Circe’s wiles, that Cyclopean lout?
13271: The indecision in his own shallow mind,
13272: And all of it! What benefit did he find?             8125
13273: Till, late indeed, the ocean favoured him more,
13274: And brought him, wave-tossed, to a friendly shore.
13275: 
13276: Thales
13277: 
13278: Such behaviour brings the wise man pain,
13279: Yet the good will chance it all again.
13280: An ounce of thanks will still please them deeply,    8130
13281: Outweighing tons of ingratitude completely.
13282: And it’s nothing slight we ask of you:
13283: The boy here wants to exist, and wisely too.
13284: 
13285: Nereus
13286: 
13287: Don’t ruin such a rare mood as this!
13288: Greater needs await me, today, than his:             8135
13289: I’ve summoned all my daughters here to me,
13290: The Dorides, the Graces of the Sea.
13291: Neither Olympus, nor your lands can show
13292: Such lovely forms, with such delicate flow,
13293: They fling themselves, with graceful actions,        8140
13294: From sea-horses to Neptune’s stallions,
13295: Blending so sensitively with the element,
13296: That they seem made of foam, to all intent.
13297: In a play of colours, on Venus’ chariot shell,
13298: Galatea, the loveliest, comes to me, as well,        8145
13299: Who, since Cypris turned away from us,
13300: Rules as the new divinity of Paphos.
13301: And so, heiress, for ages now, the sweet one,
13302: Holds town, and temple, chariot and throne.
13303: Away! It’s time for a father’s enjoyments,           8150
13304: Hearts without hate, lips without judgements.
13305: Away, to Proteus! Ask that wondrous man:
13306: How man exists, and changes, if he can.
13307: 
13308: (He vanishes into the sea.)
13309: 
13310: Thales
13311: 
13312: We’ll achieve nothing by that game,
13313: Meet Proteus: he’ll vanish, just the same:   8155
13314: And if he stays, he’ll only tell you,
13315: What will amaze you, and confuse you.
13316: But you’ve need of such advice,
13317: Well, make tracks, then, and we’ll try!
13318: 
13319: (They depart.)
13320: 
13321: The Sirens (On the rocks above.)
13322: 
13323: What is it we see whitening                  8160
13324: The realms of ocean, brightening?
13325: As when the wind prevails,
13326: And shows the snowy sails,
13327: So the Ocean’s daughters,
13328: Transfigured, light the waters.              8165
13329: Let us clamber shore-wards,
13330: So we can hear their voices.
13331: 
13332: The Nereids and Tritons
13333: 
13334: What in our hands we treasure,
13335: Will give you all great pleasure.
13336: Chelone’s turtle shield                      8170
13337: The shining form we wield:
13338: On it gods we’re bringing:
13339: Your noblest songs, be singing.
13340: 
13341: The Sirens
13342: 
13343: Little in form,
13344: Great in the storm,                          8175
13345: Saving the shipwrecked,
13346: Gods always respected.
13347: 
13348: The Nereid and Tritons
13349: 
13350: We bring the peaceful Cabiri
13351: To lead in your festivity,
13352: Since in their holy presence,        8180
13353: Neptune’s always pleasant.
13354: 
13355: The Sirens
13356: 
13357: We’re attendant on you:
13358: When a ship broke in two,
13359: Their sovereign power too,
13360: Protected the crew.                  8185
13361: 
13362: The Nereids and Tritons
13363: 
13364: We’ve brought three of them along,
13365: The fourth said he wouldn’t come:
13366: He said he was the real one,
13367: The only thinker of the squadron.
13368: 
13369: The Sirens
13370: 
13371: One god will always mock             8190
13372: At some other god.
13373: Honour all their courtesy,
13374: Be fearful of their injury.
13375: 
13376: The Nereids and Tritons
13377: 
13378: Actually, there are seven.
13379: 
13380: The Sirens
13381: 
13382: Where are the other three, then?     8195
13383: 
13384: The Nereids and Tritons
13385: We really can’t tell you that,
13386: On Olympus one might ask:
13387: There the eighth pines away,
13388: No one thinks of him today!
13389: Granted us in mercy,                   8200
13390: But not yet completely.
13391: These, the incomparable,
13392: Ever wider yearning,
13393: Hungering, are longing
13394: For the unattainable.                  8205
13395: 
13396: The Sirens
13397: 
13398: We’re ones who know
13399: Where it’s enthroned,
13400: To moon and to sun,
13401: We pray: and it’s done.
13402: 
13403: The Nereids and Tritons
13404: 
13405: See how our great glory grows,         8210
13406: We lead them to the feast!
13407: 
13408: The Sirens
13409: 
13410: The heroes of ancient story,
13411: Are deficient now in glory,
13412: Whatever we might be told:
13413: Though they won the fleece of gold,    8215
13414: You’re the Cabiri.
13415: 
13416: (Repeated as a full chorus.)
13417: 
13418: ‘Though they won the fleece of gold,
13419: We’re the Cabiri’.
13420: 
13421: (The Nereids and Tritons move past.)
13422: 
13423: Homunculus
13424: I see these unformed ones,
13425: Like pots of shoddy clay,                                       8220
13426: Against them wise men run,
13427: And break their heads today.
13428: 
13429: Thales
13430: 
13431: That’s what men ask of the dust:
13432: The coin gains value from its rust.
13433: 
13434: Proteus (Unnoticed.)
13435: 
13436: It pleases me, an old connoisseur of fable!                     8225
13437: The odder it is, the more respectable.
13438: 
13439: Thales
13440: 
13441: Where are you, Proteus?
13442: 
13443: Proteus (Like a ventriloquist, apparently far, and close to.)
13444: 
13445:                    Here! Here, too!
13446: 
13447: Thales
13448: 
13449: An old joke, which I’ll forgive you:
13450: No idle words for a friend, please!
13451: I know you’re trying to deceive.                                8230
13452: 
13453: Proteus (As if from the distance.)
13454: 
13455: Farewell!
13456: 
13457: Thales (Quietly to Homunculus.)
13458: 
13459:       He’s quite near. So, light, afresh!
13460: He’s just as curious as any fish:
13461: And whatever form he hides in,
13462: A flame will easily entice him.
13463: Homunculus
13464: 
13465: I’ll pour out a whole flood of light,                8235
13466: But soft, so the glass is still all right.
13467: 
13468: Proteus (In the form of a giant turtle.)
13469: 
13470: What shines with such grace and beauty?
13471: 
13472: Thales (Covering up Homunculus.)
13473: 
13474: Good! If you wish, come close to see.
13475: It’s worth a little trouble, if you can:
13476: Show yourself two-footed like a man.                 8240
13477: At our discretion, and by our favour.
13478: We’ll show you what we’re hiding here.
13479: 
13480: Proteus (In a noble form.)
13481: 
13482: You still know all the worldly tricks.
13483: 
13484: Thales
13485: 
13486: Changing shape is what you still like best.
13487: 
13488: (He reveals Homunculus.)
13489: 
13490: Proteus (Astonished.)
13491: 
13492: A shining dwarf! That, I’ve never seen!       8245
13493: 
13494: Thales
13495: 
13496: He seeks advice, and would gladly ‘be’.
13497: He is, as I’ve heard him say before,
13498: Quite miraculously, only half born.
13499: He’s not lacking in mental qualities,
13500: But short of physical capabilities:                  8250
13501: Only the glass has given him weight at all,
13502: He’d gladly be embodied, first of all.
13503: Proteus
13504: 
13505: You are a true virgin’s son,
13506: Before you should be, you’re already one!
13507: 
13508: Thales (Whispering.)
13509: 
13510: From another point of view, it’s critical:   8255
13511: I think it makes him hermaphroditical.
13512: 
13513: Proteus
13514: 
13515: All the easier to achieve success:
13516: Whatever he gets will suit him best.
13517: No need to think about it here:
13518: In the ocean deep you must appear!           8260
13519: There, first, in miniature, one snatches,
13520: Enjoying the smallest things to swallow,
13521: Bigger and bigger, with what one catches,
13522: Forming the higher being to follow.
13523: 
13524: Homunculus
13525: 
13526: Here quite gentle breezes blow,              8265
13527: It’s open: the fragrance delights me so!
13528: 
13529: Proteus
13530: 
13531: I think so too, loveliest of youths!
13532: And, further on, it’s more enjoyable:
13533: On that shoreline’s slender tooth,
13534: The watery halo’s indescribable.             8270
13535: There we’ll see the crowds near to,
13536: Drifting smoothly, to our view,
13537: Come with me!
13538: Thales
13539: 
13540:    I’ll keep you company.
13541: 
13542: Homunculus
13543: 
13544: A triply odd spirit-journey!
13545: Part II Act II Scene VI: The Telchines of Rhodes
13546: 
13547: (The Telchines, on sea-horses and dragons, wielding Neptune’s trident.)
13548: 
13549: Chorus of Telchines (The nine dog-headed Children of the Sea)
13550: 
13551: Oh, we are the ones who once forged Neptune’s trident,               8275
13552: With which he controls the tumultuous torrent.
13553: When the thunder erupts from the heavens, and rumbles,
13554: Neptune will reply to those terrible grumbles:
13555: And however the lightning zig-zags above us,
13556: Breaker upon breaker beneath will splash upwards:                    8280
13557: And whatever struggles between them in terror,
13558: Long hurled all about, the deep seas will devour:
13559: And that’s why he’s loaned us his sceptre today –
13560: Now we float, calm and light, in our festive display.
13561: 
13562: The Sirens
13563: 
13564: You, to Helios consecrated,                                          8285
13565: You, with bright day’s blessing freighted,
13566: Greetings to this hour when
13567: Luna’s high worship rules again!
13568: 
13569: The Telchines
13570: 
13571: Loveliest goddess of all in your sphere above!
13572: To hear your brother praised, is something you love.                 8290
13573: To blessed Rhodes lend an ear, now, from the sky,
13574: Where an endless Paean, to him, rises on high.
13575: He begins the day’s course: he ends it again,
13576: He eyes us all with his radiant fiery eye, then.
13577: The mountains, the city, the sea and the strand,                     8295
13578: Please the great god, lovely and bright is the land.
13579: No mist drifts above us, and if one appears,
13580: A ray, and a breeze: and the island shows clear!
13581: There the high god’s in hundreds of statues displayed,
13582: As a youth, and a giant, the mild and the grave.                     8300
13583: We were the first to carve forms: we began
13584: The depiction of gods in the image of Man.
13585: Proteus
13586: 
13587: Let them sing on then, and let them boast!
13588: To the sun’s sacred rays, a living host,
13589: All their works are an empty jest.           8305
13590: They melt and shape untiringly:
13591: And once, in bronze, it’s plain to see,
13592: They think they’ve caught the very best.
13593: What happens at last to these proud ones?
13594: The god’s statues standing high –            8310
13595: An earthquake tosses to the sky:
13596: Long since, they’re all melted down.
13597: Earth’s toil, whatever else it may be,
13598: Is nothing still, but drudgery:
13599: The waves grant a life that’s better:        8315
13600: I’ll bear you to eternal waters,
13601: As Proteus-Dolphin.
13602: 
13603: (Transforming himself.)
13604: 
13605:                That’s soon done!
13606: Now you’ll find your fairest luck:
13607: I’m carrying you across my back,
13608: To wed you with the ocean.                   8320
13609: 
13610: Thales
13611: 
13612: Yield to your praiseworthy wish,
13613: Start at the beginning, with the fish!
13614: Be ready for the swiftest working!
13615: Be ruled by the eternal norms,
13616: Move through a thousand, thousand forms,     8325
13617: And you’ll ascend in time to Man.
13618: 
13619: Proteus
13620: 
13621: With spirit, join the watery plan,
13622: Equal in size, where all began,
13623: And move here as you wish to do:
13624: Don’t wrestle with the higher orders:             8330
13625: Once man, inside mankind’s borders,
13626: Then all will be over with you.
13627: 
13628: Thales
13629: 
13630: That’s as may be: it’s still fine,
13631: To be a real man, in your own time.
13632: 
13633: Proteus (To Thales.)
13634: 
13635: As long as it’s someone of your kind!             8335
13636: You don’t just live for some brief time:
13637: With your pale and ghostly peers,
13638: I’ve watched you already for hundreds of years.
13639: 
13640: The Sirens (On the rocky cliffs.)
13641: 
13642: What’s that ring of little clouds, set
13643: In a circle round the moon?                       8340
13644: They are doves, by love ignited,
13645: Winged, white as winter noon.
13646: All her ardent flocks of birds:
13647: Paphos, now, has sent to us,
13648: So our festival’s completed,                      8345
13649: Sweet and clear our happy bliss!
13650: 
13651: Nereus (Approaching Thales.)
13652: 
13653: Though some nocturnal wanderer
13654: Might call it only airy moonshine:
13655: We spirits think it something other,
13656: It’s one true meaning we can find:                8350
13657: They are doves that accompany
13658: My daughter in her moving shell.
13659: Wondrous flights of artistry,
13660: Learnt in ancient times, as well.
13661: Thales
13662: 
13663: I too think that thing is best,                                      8355
13664: That can please the real man,
13665: And in warm and silent nest,
13666: Keep living Sacredness to hand.
13667: 
13668: Psylli and Marsi (Peoples of Italy and North Africa. On sea-bulls, sea-
13669: heifers and sea-rams.)
13670: 
13671: In the hollow caves of Cyprus
13672: Not yet rocked, by the sea-god,                                       8360
13673: Not yet shaken, by old Seismos,
13674: Breathed on, by eternal breezes,
13675: And, as in the ancient days,
13676: Delighting in peaceful ways,
13677: With us Venus’ chariot stays,                                         8365
13678: And through nocturnal murmurs,
13679: Through the sweet entwining waters,
13680: We lead the loveliest of daughters,
13681: Unseen by newer generation.
13682: Travelling on our gentle journey                                      8370
13683: No winged lion, or eagle fear we,
13684: Neither cross nor crescent,
13685: Though it’s throned in heaven,
13686: Though it moves and sways,
13687: Though it drives and slays,                                          8375
13688: Crops, towns, in ruin lays.
13689: We, swiftly bring on
13690: The loveliest of women.
13691: 
13692: The Sirens
13693: 
13694: Lightly now, and gently go,
13695: Round the chariot, ring on ring,                                      8380
13696: Often weaving, row by row,
13697: All in order, round it, snaking,
13698: Approach you active Nereids
13699: Sturdy women, sweetly wild,
13700: Tender Dorides bring, amidst,                                         8385
13701: Galatea, Mother’s child:
13702: Most, so goddess-like her calm,
13703: Worthy of immortality,
13704: Yet enticing, with her charm,
13705: As human femininity.                                            8390
13706: 
13707: The Dorides (In Chorus, mounted on dolphins, passing Nereus.)
13708: 
13709: Lend us, Luna, light and shadow,
13710: Clarity for flowering youth!
13711: Charming husbands here we show:
13712: Plead for them with our father, too.
13713: 
13714: (To Nereus.)
13715: 
13716: They are boys, whom we rescued                                  8395
13717: From the breaker’s teeth, and then,
13718: In the reeds and mosses bedded,
13719: Warmed them back to life again,
13720: Now with glowing kisses they
13721: Must thank us truly here today:                                 8400
13722: Look with favour now on them!
13723: 
13724: Nereus
13725: 
13726: Here there’s a dual prize, I find, to treasure:
13727: You show compassion, and it brings you pleasure.
13728: 
13729: The Dorides
13730: 
13731: Father, praise our mission, all,
13732: And sanction our fond request,                                  8405
13733: Let us hold them fast, immortal,
13734: On each young eternal breast.
13735: 
13736: Nereus
13737: 
13738: Be happy with your handsome catch,
13739: Accept the youngsters here, as men:
13740: I can’t myself grant what you ask,                              8410
13741: Since Zeus alone can make it happen.
13742: The waves that heave and rock you
13743: Leave no place for love to stand,
13744: So when this inclination leaves you,
13745: Send them quietly back to land.                   8415
13746: 
13747: The Dorides
13748: 
13749: Sweet boys, you are so dear to us,
13750: But sadly we must separate:
13751: We asked eternal faithfulness,
13752: But the gods forbid that fate.
13753: 
13754: The Young Men
13755: 
13756: We’re the valiant sailor lads,                    8420
13757: If you’d refresh us further,
13758: We’ve never had it quite so good
13759: And we’ll never have it better.
13760: 
13761: (Galatea approaches on her shell-chariot.)
13762: 
13763: Nereus
13764: 
13765: It’s you, my darling!
13766: 
13767: Galatea
13768: 
13769:                             O father! Delight!
13770: Linger, you dolphins, I’m gripped by the sight.   8425
13771: 
13772: Nereus
13773: 
13774: Past already, they’re moving past,
13775: Wheeling in circular motion:
13776: What care they for the heart’s deep emotion!
13777: Ah, if they’d just take me with them, at last!
13778: And yet, a single glance gives here,              8430
13779: Something that will last all year.
13780: Thales
13781: 
13782: Hail! Hail! Anew!
13783: How happy I feel, too,
13784: Pierced by the Beautiful and True….
13785: All things came from the watery view!               8435
13786: All things are sustained by water!
13787: Ocean, grant us your realm forever.
13788: If you didn’t produce the clouds,
13789: No flowing streams would be allowed,
13790: The rivers wouldn’t roar and shout,                 8440
13791: The streams would never bubble out,
13792: Where would hill, plain, and world be then?
13793: The freshness of life’s what you maintain.
13794: 
13795: An Echo (A chorus from the collective circles.)
13796: 
13797: The freshness of life flows back from you, again.
13798: 
13799: Nereus
13800: 
13801: Floating, turning, they change place,               8445
13802: Far off, no longer face to face:
13803: In extended linking circles,
13804: Appropriate to the festival,
13805: The countless company’s weaving.
13806: But Galatea’s throne of shell,                      8450
13807: I see it clearly: see it still.
13808: It gleams like a star,
13809: Through the throng,
13810: A crowd, the Beloved shines among!
13811: Though just as far,                                 8455
13812: It shimmers bright and clear,
13813: Always true, and near.
13814: 
13815: Homunculus
13816: 
13817: In this delightful ocean
13818: Whatever I may shine on,
13819: Is all sweet and fair.                              8460
13820: Proteus
13821: 
13822: In this living ocean,
13823: You light’s shining motion,
13824: First rings in splendour there.
13825: 
13826: Nereus
13827: 
13828: At the heart of the throng, what mystery
13829: Offers itself for our eyes to see?                   8465
13830: What shines round the shell, at Galatea’s feet?
13831: Now waxing powerful, now gentle and sweet,
13832: As if it were fed by the pulses of Love.
13833: 
13834: Thales
13835: 
13836: Homunculus, drawn there by Proteus….
13837: Those are the symptoms of imperious yearning,        8470
13838: I’d expect now the sound of an anguished ringing:
13839: He’ll shatter himself on the glittering throne:
13840: He glitters, he flashes, already, it’s done.
13841: 
13842: The Sirens
13843: 
13844: What fiery wonder transfigures the waves, there,
13845: As one on another sparkles and breaks, there?        8475
13846: It flashes and flickers and brightens towards us:
13847: The nocturnal tracks of the bodies shine round us,
13848: And everything near is surrounded with flame:
13849: So let Eros rule, now: who started the game!
13850: Hail to the sea! Hail to the waves!                  8480
13851: Circled, now, by the sacred blaze!
13852: Hail to water! Hail to fire!
13853: Hail to the rarest sweet desire!
13854: 
13855: All In Chorus
13856: 
13857: Hail, the gently flowing breeze!
13858: Hail, hidden caverns of the seas!                    8485
13859: Be honoured now, for evermore,
13860: You, the Elemental four!
13861: Part II Act III Scene I: Before the Palace of Menelaus in Sparta
13862: 
13863: (Helen enters with the Chorus of Captive Trojan Women. Panthalis is leader
13864: of the Chorus.)
13865: 
13866: Helen
13867: 
13868: I, Helen the much admired yet much reviled,
13869: Come from the shore, where recently we landed,
13870: Still drunk with the violent rocking of those waves                 8490
13871: That from Phrygian heights on high-arched backs,
13872: By Poseidon’s favour, and the East Wind’s power,
13873: Carried us here to the coast of my native land.
13874: There, below us, beside his bravest soldiers
13875: King Menelaus, now, celebrates his return.                          8495
13876: But you, bid me welcome, you, the lofty house
13877: Tyndareus my father built when he returned,
13878: Close by the slope of Pallas Athene’s hill:
13879: Here, where with Clytemnestra, in sisterhood, I
13880: And Castor and Pollux, grew and happily played:                     8500
13881: You, more nobly adorned than all Sparta’s houses.
13882: Be greeted by me, you honoured double doors!
13883: Once, Menelaus the shining bridegroom came
13884: To me, through your friendly inviting portals,
13885: I, the one singled out from among so many.                          8505
13886: Open to me once more, so that I might fulfil,
13887: The King’s command, truly, as a wife should.
13888: Let me pass! And let everything be left behind,
13889: That raged round me, till now, so full of doom.
13890: For since, light in heart, I left this place behind,                8510
13891: Seeking out Venus’ temple, in sacred duty,
13892: Where instead a Trojan robber abducted me,
13893: Many things have happened, men, far and wide,
13894: Gladly tell of, though she’s not so glad to hear them,
13895: Round whom the story grew, and myth was spun.                       8515
13896: 
13897: Chorus
13898: 
13899: O marvellous woman, don’t disdain
13900: Inheritance of the noblest estate!
13901: For the highest fate’s granted to you alone,
13902: The glory of beauty that towers above all.
13903: The Hero’s name sounds his advance,                   8520
13904: And proudly he strides:
13905: But he bows down, most stubborn of men,
13906: Before conquering Beauty, in mind and sense.
13907: 
13908: Helen
13909: 
13910: Enough of that! I’m brought here by my husband,
13911: I’ve been sent ahead by him, now, to his city:        8525
13912: But what the meaning of it is I can hardly guess.
13913: Do I come as his wife? Do I come as the Queen?
13914: Or a sacrifice, for a Prince’s bitter pain,
13915: And the ill fortune long endured by the Greeks?
13916: I’m conquered: but am I a prisoner? I can’t tell!     8530
13917: True, the Immortals appointed Fame, and Fate,
13918: As the two ambiguous, doubtful companions
13919: Of Beauty, to stand here at this threshold with me,
13920: The gloomy, threatening presences by my side.
13921: Even in the hollow ship my husband seldom             8535
13922: Gazed at me, or spoke an encouraging word.
13923: He sat in front of me, as if in evil thought.
13924: But scarcely had the foremost ship’s prow greeted
13925: Land, in that deep bay Eurotas’ mouth has made,
13926: Than he spoke to us, as the gods had urged him:       8540
13927: ‘Here my soldiers will disembark in ordered ranks,
13928: I’ll muster them, ranged along the ocean’s-shore:
13929: But you’ll go on, ever on along the banks
13930: Of sacred Eurotas, shining with bright orchards,
13931: Guide the horses through gleaming water meadows,      8545
13932: Till of your lovely journey you make an end,
13933: Where Lacedemon, once a rich spreading field,
13934: Surrounded by austere mountains, was created.
13935: Walk through the high-towered house of princes,
13936: And summon the capable old Stewardess                 8550
13937: Along with the maidservants I left behind,
13938: Let her display the store of rich treasure to you,
13939: That which your father left, and that I myself
13940: Have added to, amassing it in war and peace.
13941: You’ll find it all still in the most perfect order:    8555
13942: It is a prince’s privilege that he should find
13943: That all is loyalty, on returning to his house,
13944: All that he’s left behind still in its proper place.
13945: Since no slave has the power to effect a change.’
13946: 
13947: Chorus
13948: 
13949: Let this treasure, so steadily massed,                 8560
13950: Bring you delight, now, in eye and breast!
13951: For the necklace bright, and the crown of gold,
13952: Were resting, and darkening, in proud repose:
13953: But enter now, and claim them all,
13954: They’ll quickly respond.                               8565
13955: I love to see Beauty itself compete
13956: Against gold and pearls and glittering gems.
13957: 
13958: Helen
13959: 
13960: So again there came my lord’s imperious speech:
13961: ‘When you’ve examined all of it in due order,
13962: Take as many tripods as you think you’ll need,         8570
13963: And as many vessels as sacrifice requires,
13964: To fulfil the customs of the sacred rites.
13965: Take cauldrons, and basins, and circular bowls:
13966: The purest of water from the holy fountains,
13967: In deep urns: take care that you’ve dry wood too,      8575
13968: Such as will quickly catch fire, and hold all ready:
13969: And finally don’t forget a well-honed knife:
13970: Everything else I’ll leave for your decision.’
13971: So he spoke, at the same time urging my going:
13972: But he who commanded marked out nothing living         8580
13973: To be slain: to honour the Olympian gods.
13974: Essential, but I’ll think no more about it,
13975: And leave all things in the hands of the gods:
13976: They fulfil whatever is in their mind to do,
13977: Whether or not we think it good or evil:               8585
13978: In either case we mortals must endure it.
13979: Often the priest’s heavy axe has been lifted,
13980: From the bowed neck of the sacrificial victim,
13981: So he could not slaughter it, being hindered,
13982: By enemies near, or the gods’ intervention.        8590
13983: 
13984: Chorus
13985: 
13986: What might happen, think not of that:
13987: Queen, go on, now, step inside,
13988: And be brave!
13989: Good and evil come
13990: Unannounced, to Mankind:                           8595
13991: Though it’s proclaimed, we’ll not believe.
13992: Troy still burned: did we not see
13993: Death in our faces, shameful death:
13994: And are we not here,
13995: Your friends, happily serving,                     8600
13996: Seeing the blinding sun in the sky
13997: Seeing the Loveliest on Earth,
13998: You, the kind: we the joyous?
13999: 
14000: Helen
14001: 
14002: Let it be, as it will! Whatever awaits me,
14003: I must go, swiftly, up to that royal house,        8605
14004: Long forsaken, often longed for, almost lost,
14005: That’s before my eyes once more: I know not how.
14006: My feet don’t carry me onwards so bravely, now,
14007: Up those high steps, I skipped over as a child.
14008: 
14009: Chorus
14010: 
14011: Sorrowful prisoners,                               8610
14012: Oh, cast away, Sisters,
14013: All your pain, to the winds:
14014: Share in your mistress’ joy
14015: Share now in Helen’s joy,
14016: Who returns, truly late indeed,
14017: To her father’s hearth and home,                   8615
14018: But with all the more firm a step,
14019: Delightedly approaching.
14020: Praise the sacred gods,
14021: Creating happiness,                                     8620
14022: Bringing the wanderer home!
14023: See the freed prisoner
14024: Soar on uplifted wings,
14025: Over harshness, while, all in vain,
14026: The captives, so full of longing,                       8625
14027: Pine away, arms still outstretched,
14028: To the walls of their prison.
14029: 
14030: But a god snatched her up, then,
14031: The far-exiled:
14032: And from Ilium’s fall,                                  8630
14033: Carried her back once more, home
14034: To the old, to the newly adorned, her
14035: Father’s house,
14036: From unspeakable
14037: Rapture and torment,                                    8635
14038: Now, reborn, to remember
14039: The days of her childhood.
14040: 
14041: Panthalis (As leader of the Chorus.)
14042: 
14043: Now leave behind the joyful path of your singing,
14044: And turn your eyes towards the open doorway!
14045: Sisters, what do I see! Surely the Queen returns        8640
14046: Waking towards us, again, with anxious steps?
14047: What is it, great Queen? What can you have met with,
14048: Within the halls of your house, instead of greetings,
14049: To cause you such trembling? You can hide nothing,
14050: Since I see your reluctance written on your brow,       8645
14051: And amazement competes there with noble anger.
14052: 
14053: Helen (Who has left the doors open, in her turmoil.)
14054: 
14055: A daughter of Zeus is stirred by no common fear,
14056: No lightly passing hand of Terror can touch her:
14057: Only the Horror that the womb of ancient Night,
14058: Raised from chaos, and shaped in its many forms,        8650
14059: In glowing clouds that shoot, upwards and outwards,
14060: From the peak’s fiery throat, to shake the hero’s breast.
14061: So here today the Stygian gods have marked
14062: The entrance to my house with terror: and gladly
14063: I’d take myself far away, like a guest let go,                8655
14064: Far from this often trodden, long yearned for threshold.
14065: But no! I’ve retreated here now, into the light,
14066: And you Powers will drive me no further, whoever
14067: You are. Rather, I’ll think of some consecration,
14068: So the hearth-fire, cleansed, greets the wife, as the lord.   8660
14069: 
14070: The Leader of the Chorus
14071: 
14072: Noble lady, reveal to your maidservants here,
14073: Who help you reverently, what has happened.
14074: 
14075: Helen
14076: 
14077: You’ll see what I saw yourselves, with your own eyes,
14078: If ancient Night has not, straight away, swallowed it,
14079: That shape of hers: withdrawn it to her heart’s depths.       8665
14080: But I’ll picture it to you in words, so you’ll know:
14081: As, with those recent orders in mind, I trod,
14082: Gravely, through the palace’s innermost room,
14083: Awed by the silence of the gloomy corridors,
14084: No sound of busy labour greeting my ears,                     8670
14085: No sound of prompt, diligent effort meeting my eye,
14086: No Stewardess appeared, and no maidservants,
14087: No courtesy such as usually greets the stranger.
14088: But as I approached closer to the hearth stone
14089: Beside the glowing ashes that remained, I saw                 8675
14090: A veiled woman, vast shape, seated on the floor,
14091: Not like one who’s asleep, but one deep in thought.
14092: I summoned her to work, with words of command,
14093: Thinking she was the Stewardess whom my husband,
14094: Had placed there perhaps, with foresight, when he left.       8680
14095: But she still sat there, crouched and immoveable:
14096: At last, stirred by my threats, she raised her arm,
14097: As if she gestured me away from hearth and hall.
14098: I turned aside from her, angrily, and sped,
14099: To the steps where the Thalamos is adorned                    8685
14100: On high, and close beside it the treasure house:
14101: Suddenly that strange shape sprang up from the floor,
14102: Barring my way, imperiously, showing herself,
14103: Tall and haggard, with hollow, blood-coloured gaze:
14104: A shape so weird that mind and eye were troubled.             8690
14105: But I talk to the wind: for words weary themselves
14106: Trying to conjure forms, vainly, like some creator.
14107: See for yourselves! She even dares the daylight!
14108: Here am I mistress, till the King, my lord, shall come.
14109: Phoebus, beauty’s friend, drives the horrid spawn of Night    8695
14110: To caverns underground, or he binds them fast.
14111: 
14112: (Phorkyas appears on the threshold, between the doorposts.)
14113: 
14114: Chorus
14115: 
14116: Much have I learned, although the locks
14117: Curl youthfully still across my temples!
14118: Many the terrible things I’ve seen,
14119: The soldiers’ misery, Ilium’s night,                          8700
14120: When it fell.
14121: 
14122: Through the clouded, and dust-filled turmoil,
14123: The press of warriors, I heard the gods
14124: Calling terribly, heard the ringing
14125: Iron voice of Discord through the field,                      8705
14126: City-wards.
14127: 
14128: Ah! They still stood there, Ilium’s
14129: Walls, but the glow of the flames
14130: Soon ran from neighbour to neighbour,
14131: Ever spreading, hither and thither,                           8710
14132: With the breath of their storm,
14133: Over the darkening city.
14134: Fleeing, through smoke and heat, I saw
14135: Amid the tongues of soaring fire,
14136: The fearful angry presence of gods,          8715
14137: Marvellous, those striding figures,
14138: Like giants, they were, through the gloom,
14139: The fire-illumined vapour.
14140: 
14141: Did I see that Confusion,
14142: Or did the fear-consumed Spirit              8720
14143: Create it? Never will I be able,
14144: To say, but I’m truly certain
14145: Of this, that here I see, Her,
14146: Monstrous shape to my eyes:
14147: My hand could even touch Her,                8725
14148: If terror did not restrain me,
14149: Saving me from danger.
14150: 
14151: Which of the daughters
14152: Of Phorkyas are you?
14153: Since I liken you                            8730
14154: To that family.
14155: 
14156: Are you perhaps one of the Graeae,
14157: A single eye and a single tooth,
14158: Owned alternately between you,
14159: One born of greyness?                        8735
14160: 
14161: Monster, do you dare
14162: Here, next to Beauty,
14163: Show yourself to Phoebus,
14164: And his knowing gaze?
14165: 
14166: Then step out before him regardless:         8740
14167: Since he’ll not look at what’s ugly,
14168: Just as his holy eye,
14169: Has never seen shadow.
14170: Yet we mortals are compelled, ah,
14171: By unfortunate gloomy fate,                                8745
14172: To the unspeakably painful sight
14173: She, reprehensible, ever ill fated,
14174: Provokes in the lover of Beauty.
14175: 
14176: Yet hear me then, if you boldly
14177: Encounter us: hear the curse,                              8750
14178: Hear the threat of every abuse,
14179: From the condemnatory mouth of the fortunate,
14180: Whom the gods themselves have created.
14181: 
14182: Phorkyas (The transformed Mephistopheles.)
14183: 
14184: The saying is old, with meaning noble and true,
14185: That Beauty and Shame, together, hand in hand,             8755
14186: Never pursue the same path, over green Earth.
14187: Such ancient, deep-rooted hatred lives in both,
14188: That whenever they meet, by chance, on the way,
14189: The one will always turn her back on her rival.
14190: Then quickly and fiercely each goes on, again,             8760
14191: Shame downcast, but Beauty mocking in spirit,
14192: Till in the end Orcus’ dark void shall take her,
14193: If age hasn’t, long before then, tamed her pride.
14194: So now I find you, impudent, come from abroad,
14195: With overflowing arrogance, like the cranes,               8765
14196: Their noisily croaking ranks, high overhead,
14197: Their long cloud, sending its creaking tones, down here,
14198: Tempting the quiet traveller to look upwards:
14199: Yet they pursue their way, while he follows his:
14200: And that’s the way it will be with us as well.             8770
14201: What then are you, wild Maenads or Bacchantes,
14202: That dare to rage round the great royal palace?
14203: Who are you, then, who howl at this high house’s
14204: Stewardess, like a pack of bitches, at the moon?
14205: Do you think it’s hidden from me what race you are?        8775
14206: You brood, begotten in battle, raised on slaughter,
14207: Lusting for men, the seducers and the seduced,
14208: Draining the soldiers’ and the citizens’ powers!
14209: To see your crowd’s like watching a vast swarm
14210: Of locusts settle here, darkening the fields.           8780
14211: You the wasters of others labour! Nibbling,
14212: Destroying, the ripening crops of prosperity!
14213: Defeated, bartered, sold in the market, you!
14214: 
14215: Helen
14216: 
14217: Who abuses the servants before the mistress,
14218: Presumptuously usurping a wife’s true rights?           8785
14219: Only to her is it given to praise whatever’s
14220: Praiseworthy: and to punish what is at fault.
14221: I’m well content, as well, with all the services
14222: They provided to me, when Ilium’s great might,
14223: Stood beleaguered, and fell in ruins: none the less     8790
14224: Just as we’ve endured the wretched wandering
14225: Journey, where often one thinks only of oneself,
14226: So here I expect it now from a happier crew:
14227: A lord asks how slaves serve, not what they are.
14228: So be silent, then, and no longer jeer at them.         8795
14229: If you’ve guarded the king’s house well until now,
14230: In place of the mistress, such is to your credit:
14231: But now that she comes herself, you should draw back,
14232: Lest you find punishment instead of fair reward.
14233: 
14234: Phorkyas
14235: 
14236: Disciplining servants is a prerogative                  8800
14237: That the noble wife of a king, loved by the gods,
14238: Has duly earned by years of wise discretion.
14239: Since you, acknowledged, take up your former place
14240: Once more, as Queen, and mistress of the house,
14241: Resume the slackened reins again, and rule here,        8805
14242: Hold the treasure in your keeping, and us with it.
14243: But first of all defend me, who am the elder,
14244: Against this crowd, who if they are compared
14245: To your swanlike beauty, are only cackling geese.
14246: The Leader of the Chorus
14247: 
14248: How ugly ugliness looks, next to beauty.                            8810
14249: 
14250: Phorkyas
14251: 
14252: How stupid the lack of reason, next to sense.
14253: 
14254: (From here on the Chorus answer in turn, stepping forward one by one.)
14255: 
14256: First Member of the Chorus
14257: 
14258: Tell us of Father Erebus: tell us of Mother Night.
14259: 
14260: Phorkyas
14261: 
14262: Speak about Scylla, sweet sister of your race.
14263: 
14264: Second Member of the Chorus
14265: 
14266: There are plenty of monsters in your family tree.
14267: 
14268: Phorkyas
14269: 
14270: Go down to Orcus, look for your tribe down there!                   8815
14271: 
14272: Third Member of the Chorus
14273: 
14274: Those who are down there are far too young for you.
14275: 
14276: Phorkyas
14277: 
14278: Try your arts of seduction on old Tiresias.
14279: 
14280: Fourth Member of the Chorus
14281: 
14282: Orion’s nurse was your great great-grandchild.
14283: Phorkyas
14284: 
14285: I suspect that the Harpies raised you all, on filth.
14286: 
14287: Fifth Member of the Chorus
14288: 
14289: What do you feed your perfect leanness on?                8820
14290: 
14291: Phorkyas
14292: 
14293: Not on the blood that you all lust so much for.
14294: 
14295: Sixth Member of the Chorus
14296: 
14297: You hunger for corpses, you, foul corpse yourself!
14298: 
14299: Phorkyas
14300: 
14301: Vampire’s teeth gleam there, in your shameless muzzle.
14302: 
14303: The Leader of the Chorus
14304: 
14305: It would shut yours tight, if I called out who you are.
14306: 
14307: Phorkyas
14308: 
14309: Well say your own name first: that’ll solve the riddle.          8825
14310: 
14311: Helen
14312: 
14313: I intervene, not in anger but in sorrow,
14314: To forbid this alternating discord!
14315: A ruler meets with nothing that’s more harmful
14316: Than private disputes of his quarrelling servants.
14317: Then his firm orders are no longer answered                      8830
14318: With swiftly answering and harmonious action,
14319: Instead, wilful commotion roars around him:
14320: Self-composure lost, he abuses them in vain.
14321: Not only that. Unacceptably, in anger,
14322: You’ve summoned the wretched shapes of dreadful forms,           8835
14323: They surround me, so I feel I’m being whirled
14324: To Orcus, from these familiar paternal fields.
14325: Am I remembering? Did delusion grip me?
14326: Was I all of that? Am I, now? And shall be still,
14327: Symbol of dream and fear, to those who waste cities?   8840
14328: The maidservants shudder, but you, the eldest,
14329: Stand there calmly: speak words of reason to me!
14330: 
14331: Phorkyas
14332: 
14333: The favour of the gods seems only a dream
14334: To one who recalls the troubles of long ages.
14335: But you, blessed, beyond all aim and measure,          8845
14336: Quickly inflamed to every sort of daring risk,
14337: Only found fires of love, in the realm of life,
14338: Theseus, driven by lust, abducted you, a child,
14339: He strong as Hercules: a man nobly formed.
14340: 
14341: Helen
14342: 
14343: He carried me off, a slender ten-year old fawn,        8850
14344: And caged me in Aphidnus’ tower in Attica.
14345: 
14346: Phorkyas
14347: 
14348: But soon freed, by the hands of Castor and Pollux,
14349: A crowd of suitors, the heroes, swarmed round you.
14350: 
14351: Helen
14352: 
14353: Yet, I freely confess, above all, Patroclus
14354: The image of Achilles, had my secret favour,           8855
14355: 
14356: Phorkyas
14357: 
14358: But your father’s will bound you to Menelaus,
14359: The brave sea rover, the defender of his house.
14360: Helen
14361: 
14362: He gave him his daughter, and command of the state.
14363: Hermione came from our married existence.
14364: 
14365: Phorkyas
14366: 
14367: But while he disputed his right to far off Crete,     8860
14368: To you, the lonely, came all too handsome a guest.
14369: 
14370: Helen
14371: 
14372: Why do you recall that semi-widowhood,
14373: And all the terrible ruin it caused around me?
14374: 
14375: Phorkyas
14376: 
14377: To me, a free-born Cretan, his same journey
14378: Brought captivity and years of slavery.               8865
14379: 
14380: Helen
14381: 
14382: He ordered you here at once, as Stewardess,
14383: Entrusting the fortress and his treasure to you.
14384: 
14385: Phorkyas
14386: 
14387: Which you abandoned, for Ilium’s high city,
14388: And the inexhaustible delights of love.
14389: 
14390: Helen
14391: 
14392: Not delights, be sure! All too bitter a sorrow        8870
14393: Was poured endlessly over my head and breast.
14394: 
14395: Phorkyas
14396: 
14397: Yet they say that you appeared in dual form,
14398: Seen in Troy and, at the same time, in Egypt.
14399: Helen
14400: 
14401: Don’t confuse my clouded, wandering mind completely.
14402: To this moment, I don’t know which of them I am.       8875
14403: 
14404: Phorkyas
14405: 
14406: Then they say: Achilles became your companion,
14407: Came, burning, from the empty realm of shadows!
14408: He’d loved you before, opposing fate’s command.
14409: 
14410: Helen
14411: 
14412: As phantom, I bound myself to a phantom.
14413: It was a dream, as the tales themselves tell.          8880
14414: I fade, now, become a phantom to myself.
14415: 
14416: (She sinks into the arms of the Chorus.)
14417: 
14418: Chorus
14419: 
14420: Silence! Silence!
14421: False-seeing one, false-speaking one, you!
14422: Out of the terrible single-toothed
14423: Mouth, what might be breathed, so,                     8885
14424: Out of so frightful a throat of horror!
14425: Now the malevolent, seemingly benevolent,
14426: Wolf’s anger under the woolly fleece,
14427: Is more terrible to me than the jaws
14428: Of the three-headed dog.                               8890
14429: We stand here anxiously listening:
14430: When? How? Where, will such malice
14431: Break out now
14432: From this predatory monster?
14433: 
14434: Now rather than friendly words, richly laced           8895
14435: With trust, waters of Lethe, sweet and mild,
14436: You stir up all from the past,
14437: The evil more than the good,
14438: And instantly darken
14439: The gleam of the present                                                 8900
14440: And also the future’s
14441: Sweetly glimmering, hopeful dawn.
14442: 
14443: Silence! Silence!
14444: So the Queen’s spirit, now,
14445: Almost ready to leave her,                                               8905
14446: Can still hold, and uphold
14447: This, the form of all forms
14448: On which the sun ever lighted.
14449: 
14450: (Helen has recovered, and stands in the centre again.)
14451: 
14452: Phorkyas
14453: 
14454: Shining out from fleeting vapours, comes the sunlight of our day, here,
14455: That when veiled could so delight us, but in splendour only blinds us. 8910
14456: As the world is open to you, when you show your lovely face, now,
14457: Though they scorn me so as ugly, still I know the beautiful.
14458: 
14459: Helen
14460: 
14461: I step, trembling, from the abyss that, in fainting, closed around me,
14462: And would gladly rest my body, tired and weary are my limbs:
14463: But it’s proper for a Queen, then, as it is for all about her,           8915
14464: To be calm, and courageous, whatever harm shall threaten.
14465: 
14466: Phorkyas
14467: 
14468: In your Majesty, and Beauty, standing here, now, before us,
14469: Your look says it commands us. What do you command? Speak out.
14470: 
14471: Helen
14472: 
14473: Prepare yourselves to atone for what your quarrel has neglected:
14474: Hurry with your sacrifice, now, as the king himself commanded.           8920
14475: 
14476: 
14477: Phorkyas
14478: All is ready in the palace, bowls, and tripods, sharpened axe-blade,
14479: For the sprinkling, incense burning: show me now the ready victim!
14480: 
14481: Helen
14482: 
14483: That the king has failed to tell me.
14484: 
14485: Phorkyas
14486: 
14487:                                   He said nothing? Words of woe!
14488: 
14489: Helen
14490: 
14491: What’s this woe that overcomes you?
14492: 
14493: Phorkyas
14494: 
14495:                            Queen, it means you must be slaughtered!
14496: 
14497: Helen
14498: 
14499: I?
14500: 
14501: Phorkyas
14502: 
14503:         And them.
14504: 
14505: Chorus
14506: 
14507:              Oh, pain and suffering!
14508: 
14509: Phorkyas
14510: 
14511:                                         You will fall beneath the axe.   8925
14512: 
14513: 
14514: Helen
14515: 
14516: Presaged, though still dreadful: I, alas!
14517: Phorkyas
14518: 
14519:                                               There’s no escaping.
14520: 
14521: Chorus
14522: 
14523: Oh! And us? What happens to us?
14524: 
14525: Phorkyas
14526: 
14527:                                        She will die a noble death, then:
14528: But you’ll hang in rows together, struggling, all along the rafters
14529: Holding up the gabled roof there, as bird-catchers dangle thrushes.
14530: 
14531: (Helena and the Chorus stand stunned and alarmed, in striking composed
14532: groups.)
14533: 
14534: Phantoms! – Frozen images, you stand, parted                               8930
14535: From that light you can’t belong to, in your terror.
14536: Men, and the tribe of phantoms you resemble,
14537: Will never willingly forgo the sunlight:
14538: But none are saved from their fate, or can defer it.
14539: All know it’s true, but only a few accept it.                              8935
14540: Enough, you’re lost! Now, quickly: start the work.
14541: 
14542: (She claps her hands: muffled dwarfish forms appear in the doorway, and
14543: quickly carry out her orders.)
14544: 
14545: This way, you spheres, shadowy rounded forms!
14546: Roll over here: and do what harm you wish.
14547: Set up the gold-horned altar that you carry,
14548: Let the gleaming axe lie there on the silver rim,                          8940
14549: Fill the urns with water to wash away
14550: All the hideous stains of darkened blood.
14551: Spread the rich carpets out, here, over the dust,
14552: So the sacrifice can kneel in royal manner,
14553: And be wrapped around, once the head is severed,                       8945
14554: And buried decently there, and with due honour.
14555: The Leader of the Chorus
14556: 
14557: The Queen stands here beside us deep in thought,
14558: The maidservants wither away like mown grass:
14559: I think that I, as the eldest, am bound, in sacred duty,
14560: To barter words with you, the eldest of all by far.                 8950
14561: You’re wise, experienced, and seem well-disposed,
14562: And though this foolish crowd baited you in error,
14563: Speak of a way to escape this fate, if you know it.
14564: 
14565: Phorkyas
14566: 
14567: That’s easily done: it depends on the Queen alone,
14568: To save herself, and you her followers with her.                    8955
14569: But decision is required, and of the swiftest.
14570: 
14571: Chorus
14572: 
14573: Most honoured of Fates, wisest of Sibyls, you,
14574: Hold the gold shears apart: bring both aid and light:
14575: Already, we feel ourselves swinging, struggling,
14576: Fearful, for our limbs would rather be dancing,                     8960
14577: And afterwards rest, soft, on our lovers’ breast.
14578: 
14579: Helen
14580: 
14581: Let them be afraid! I feel pain but no terror:
14582: Yet if rescue’s possible, I gladly accept.
14583: To the wise, far-seeing mind, the impossible
14584: Is often revealed as possible. Speak: say on!                       8965
14585: 
14586: Chorus
14587: 
14588: Speak, and tell us, tell us quickly: how we might escape the terror,
14589: Dreadful nooses that still threaten, like some kind of evil necklace
14590: Wound around our tender necks? Already we, oh, wretched creatures,
14591: Feel the choking, suffocating, if you, Rhea, the great mother
14592: Of the gods, won’t show us mercy.                                    8970
14593: Phorkyas
14594: 
14595: Have you the patience to listen, to long winded
14596: Speeches, in silence? The history’s endless.
14597: 
14598: Chorus
14599: 
14600: Patience enough! While we’re listening, we’re alive.
14601: 
14602: Phorkyas
14603: 
14604: He who stays at home to guard his noble wealth
14605: And secures the high walls of his lofty dwelling,        8975
14606: And maintains his roof against the driving rain,
14607: Will prosper in all the days of his long life:
14608: But whoever, in guilt, crosses the square-cut stones
14609: Of the sacred threshold, swiftly, with fleeing steps,
14610: Will, indeed find the ancient place, on their return,    8980
14611: But altered in every way, if not overthrown.
14612: 
14613: Helen
14614: 
14615: Why recount these familiar sayings here?
14616: If you’d relate things: don’t provoke annoyance.
14617: 
14618: Phorkyas
14619: 
14620: It’s simple fact, in no way a criticism.
14621: Menelaus sailed from bay to bay, looting,                8985
14622: Skirted the coast and islands, aggressively,
14623: Returned with the spoils that are rusting there.
14624: Then he spent ten long years there in front of Troy:
14625: And I don’t know how many more, on the way home.
14626: And how are things now with this place where we stand,   8990
14627: Tyndareus’ noble house, and the region round?
14628: 
14629: Helen
14630: 
14631: Do you embrace all scorn so completely
14632: You can only open your mouth to criticise?
14633: Phorkyas
14634: 
14635: The vales were neglected for so many years,
14636: Those that rise behind Sparta, to the northward,        8995
14637: Beyond Taygetus, from where, a living stream,
14638: Eurotas, pours downward, then along our valley,
14639: Flows by our broad reed-beds, to feed your swans.
14640: Up there, in the mountain vales, a bold race settled,
14641: Pushing southward from Cimmerian darkness,              9000
14642: And then built an inaccessible fortress there,
14643: From which, at will, they harass land and people.
14644: 
14645: Helen
14646: 
14647: Have they achieved all that? It seems unlikely.
14648: 
14649: Phorkyas
14650: 
14651: They’ve had time, perhaps twenty years in all.
14652: 
14653: Helena
14654: 
14655: Is there a leader? Are they a band of robbers?          9005
14656: 
14657: Phorkyas
14658: 
14659: Not robbers, but one of them acts as leader.
14660: I don’t curse him, though he attacked me too.
14661: He might have taken all, but was satisfied
14662: With gifts, not tribute, as he called them.
14663: 
14664: Helen
14665: 
14666: How did he look?
14667: 
14668: Phorkyas
14669: 
14670:         Less than evil! He pleased me well.             9010
14671: He’s vigorous, daring, and sophisticated,
14672: An intelligent man: as few among the Greeks.
14673: They call his race Barbarians, but I’m doubtful
14674: If they are any crueller than those heroes
14675: Who proved such devourers of men, before Troy.          9015
14676: I respected his greatness, and confided in him.
14677: His fortress! You should see with your own eyes!
14678: It’s a great deal more than the clumsy masonry
14679: Your father rolled together, higgledy-piggledy,
14680: Cyclopean as a Cyclops, piling raw stone,               9020
14681: Over raw stone: there, instead there, it’s all
14682: Plumb line and balance: it’s laid out by rule.
14683: Look from outside! It rises straight to the sky,
14684: So firm, tightly jointed – smooth as a steel mirror
14685: To climb – that even your thoughts slide off!           9025
14686: And, inside, great courts with plenty of room,
14687: Ringed by buildings, of every use and nature.
14688: There you’ll see pillars, columns, arches, quoins,
14689: Balconies, galleries, facing inwards and outwards,
14690: And coats of arms.
14691: 
14692: Chorus
14693: 
14694:                    What arms are those?
14695: 
14696: Phorkyas
14697: 
14698:                                          Ajax carried   9030
14699: A writhing snake on his shield: you yourself saw it.
14700: The Seven against Thebes also bore their symbols
14701: On each of their shields, replete with meaning.
14702: There you saw moons, and stars in the night sky,
14703: Heroes and Goddesses, torches, ladders, swords,         9035
14704: And whatever fierce weapons threaten fine cities.
14705: Our heroic band carries such images too,
14706: In bright colours, bestowed by our ancestors.
14707: There you see lions, eagles with beaks and claws,
14708: Horns of oxen, wings, roses, and peacocks’ tails,       9040
14709: Bands too made of gold, black, silver, blue and red.
14710: The like of these hang in their halls, row on row.
14711: In spacious halls, as wide as the whole wide world:
14712: You could dance there!
14713: 
14714: Chorus
14715: 
14716:                  Say then, are there dancers, there?
14717: 
14718: Phorkyas
14719: 
14720: The best! A lively crowd of golden-haired youths.       9045
14721: The fragrance of youth! Paris was fragrant, thus,
14722: When he grew close to the Queen.
14723: 
14724: Helen
14725: 
14726:                         You mistake your role
14727: Completely: now speak your closing lines to me!
14728: 
14729: Phorkyas
14730: 
14731: No, you speak the last! Grave, and distinct say: Yes!
14732: And I’ll surround you with that fortress.
14733: 
14734: Chorus
14735: 
14736:                                          O, speak       9050
14737: That one short word, and save both yourself, and us!
14738: 
14739: Helen
14740: 
14741: What? Do I fear King Menelaus would commit
14742: Such a cruel offence as to make me kill myself?
14743: 
14744: Phorkyas
14745: 
14746: Have you forgotten how he wreaked mutilation,
14747: Unheard-of, on Deiphobus, dead Paris’ brother,          9055
14748: Because he stubbornly claimed you, the widow,
14749: And prized you? He cropped both nose and ears,
14750: And disfigured him, there: It was terrible to see.
14751: Helen
14752: 
14753: Yes he did that, and he did it for my sake.
14754: 
14755: Phorkyas
14756: 
14757: Because of it, now, he’ll do the same to you.                        9060
14758: Beauty is indivisible: he who owns it
14759: Destroys it, rather than share a part of it.
14760: 
14761: (Trumpets sound in the distance: the Chorus starts in terror.)
14762: 
14763: As a trumpet call pierces the ear to grip
14764: And tear the innards: Jealousy drives her claws
14765: Into the breast of him who can never forget                          9065
14766: What once he had, and lost, and no longer has.
14767: 
14768: Chorus
14769: 
14770: Don’t you hear the trumpets calling? Don’t you see the flash of swords?
14771: 
14772: Phorkyas
14773: 
14774: King and master, now be welcome, gladly I’ll offer my account.
14775: 
14776: Chorus
14777: 
14778: But, what of us?
14779: 
14780: Phorkyas
14781: 
14782:              In truth, you know that her death’s before your eyes,
14783: Find your own death there within them: there’s no hope left for you. 9070
14784: 
14785: (A Pause.)
14786: 
14787: Helen
14788: 
14789: I ponder this simple thing that I might try.
14790: You are a hostile daemon: I feel it deeply,
14791: I’m fearful you’ll still make evil out of good.
14792: But then, I’ll follow you to that fortress, there:
14793: I know the rest: but what the Queen might conceal                    9075
14794: Concerning it, mysteriously, in her heart,
14795: Be unknown to all. Now, old one, lead the way!
14796: 
14797: Chorus
14798: 
14799: O, how gladly we’re going,
14800: On hurrying feet:
14801: Death is behind:                                                     9080
14802: Before us again,
14803: Towering fortress
14804: Inaccessible walls.
14805: Though they guard us as well
14806: As Ilium’s citadel,                                                  9085
14807: Still in the end, it
14808: Fell, through the basest of ruses.
14809: 
14810: (Mists rise and spread, obscuring the background, and the nearer part of the
14811: scene, at will.)
14812: 
14813: What is this? How?
14814: Sisters, look round!
14815: Wasn’t it loveliest day?                                             9090
14816: Strips of vapour hover about,
14817: Rise from Eurotas’ holy stream:
14818: Already the loveliest
14819: Reed-wreathed shore has vanished from sight:
14820: And the proud, free, graceful                                        9095
14821: Gentle glide of the swans
14822: Swimming in sociable joy,
14823: I alas see, no more!
14824: 
14825: Yet still, still
14826: I hear them calling,                                                 9100
14827: In hoarse tones, calling afar!
14828: Proclaiming death, they are speaking.
14829: Ah, that to us they may not,
14830: Instead of salvation promised,
14831: Proclaim our ruin, at last:                                          9105
14832: To us, the swanlike, long,
14833: Lovely, white-throated, and ah!
14834: Our Queen born of the swan.
14835: Woe to us, woe!
14836: 
14837: All’s hidden already                                                 9110
14838: Vapour’s swirling around.
14839: Now we can’t see one another!
14840: What’s happening? Are we moving?
14841: 
14842: 
14843: We’re hovering with
14844: Straggling steps along the ground?                                   9115
14845: Can’t you see? Isn’t that Hermes
14846: Soaring ahead? Doesn’t his gold wand gleam,
14847: Beckoning us, ordering us back again
14848: To the wholly joyless, and greyly-twilit,
14849: Intangible, phantom-filled,                                          9120
14850: Overcrowded, ever-empty Hades?
14851: 
14852: Yes, at once, now, all is darkening, dully all the vapours vanish,
14853: Grey with gloom, and brown as walls. Walls appearing to our vision,
14854: Blank now to our clearer vision. A court now is it? Or a deep pit?
14855: Fearful, though, in either case, now! Sisters, oh! We are imprisoned, 9125
14856: Captives, as we’ve never been.
14857: Part II Act III Scene II: The Inner Court of The Castle
14858: 
14859: (Surrounded with richly ornamented buildings of the Middle Ages.)
14860: 
14861: The Leader of the Chorus
14862: 
14863: Hasty and foolish, and typical of womankind!
14864: They hang on the moment, sport of every breeze,
14865: Of every chance and mischance, never knowing
14866: How to suffer either calmly! One’s always certain,                  9130
14867: Fiercely, to contradict the others, others her:
14868: Only, they laugh or cry alike, in joy or pain.
14869: Now, hush! And listen to what our high-minded
14870: Mistress may decide, here, for herself and us.
14871: 
14872: Helen
14873: 
14874: Pythoness, where are you? However you’re named:                     9135
14875: Come out from the arches of this dark fortress.
14876: If you come from the wondrous lord and hero
14877: To announce me, and ready a fit reception,
14878: Accept my thanks, and lead me there quickly:
14879: I wish my wanderings ended. I want to rest.                         9140
14880: 
14881: The Leader of the Chorus
14882: 
14883: Queen, in vain, you look about in all directions:
14884: That wretched shape has vanished, stayed perhaps
14885: There in the vapour, out of whose depths we came,
14886: I cannot tell how, so swiftly, without a footfall.
14887: Perhaps she wanders lost in the vast labyrinth                      9145
14888: Of these many castles wondrously merged in one.
14889: Seeking high and princely greeting from her lord.
14890: But see! There a crowd moves about in readiness.
14891: Along galleries, at windows, through the doors
14892: Come a crowd of servants, scurrying to and fro:                     9150
14893: It proclaims a noblest welcome for the guest.
14894: Chorus
14895: 
14896: My heart is eased! O, see over there,
14897: How a company of handsome youths approach
14898: With lingering step, in dignified order,
14899: Marching in ranks. Who gave out the command                          9155
14900: To marshal them, and so quickly arranged
14901: All this youthful team of so handsome a race?
14902: What shall I admire most? Is it the graceful step,
14903: Or the curls of hair on the palest of brows,
14904: Or the rounded cheeks with a peach’s blushes,                        9160
14905: And like it also, in their silkiest down?
14906: I’d gladly bite, yet I’m frightened to try it:
14907: Since in a similar case, and I shudder to say it,
14908: The mouth was as suddenly filled, with ashes!
14909: 
14910: But the handsomest                                                   9165
14911: Come to us now:
14912: What do they carry?
14913: Steps for the throne,
14914: Carpets and seat,
14915: Curtain, canopy,                                                     9170
14916: Jewelled finery:
14917: Waving above us,
14918: Forming a garland,
14919: Over the head of our Queen:
14920: For she, already, invited                                            9175
14921: Ascends, to the noble seat.
14922: Forward now,
14923: Step by step,
14924: Solemnly ranked.
14925: Worthy, O worthy, triply worthy,                                     9180
14926: Let such a reception be blessed!
14927: 
14928: (What the Chorus has described takes place. After the boys and squires have
14929: descended in long procession, Faust appears above, at the top of the
14930: staircase, in the costume of a knight of the Middle Ages, and then descends
14931: slowly and with dignity.)
14932: The Leader of the Chorus (Observing him closely.)
14933: 
14934: If indeed the gods have not, as they often do,
14935: Only lent this man brave form, for an instant,
14936: Exalted his dignity, and charming presence,
14937: As a temporary act, then whatever he does           9185
14938: He’ll succeed, whether it’s warring with men,
14939: Or in the lesser struggles with lovely ladies.
14940: Truly I prefer him to hosts of others,
14941: Whom my eyes have seen, the highly praised.
14942: I see the Prince approach, with slow solemn step,   9190
14943: Restrained by reverence: Queen, turn towards him!
14944: 
14945: Faust (Approaching: a man in chains at his side.)
14946: 
14947: Instead of the usual calm greeting
14948: Instead of a reverential welcome,
14949: Here I bring a wretch bound fast with chains,
14950: Who failed so in his duty, I failed mine.           9195
14951: Kneel here, so this noble lady
14952: May hear a prompt confession of your guilt.
14953: This, royal Mistress, is the man selected
14954: Because of his keen vision to gaze about
14955: From the high tower, and to look keenly
14956: At heaven’s spaces, and the breadth of earth,       9200
14957: To report whatever moves here or there,
14958: From the encircling hills, to the castle,
14959: Whether a transit of the woolly flocks,
14960: Or soldiers: so we can protect the first,
14961: Attack the others. Today, negligence!               9205
14962: You came here: he had nothing to report:
14963: We failed in the reception you deserved,
14964: In honour of the guest. Now he forfeits
14965: His guilty life, and would have shed his blood      9210
14966: In a merited death: but only you alone
14967: Shall pardon him or punish, as you wish.
14968: Helen
14969: 
14970: Such great power you choose to grant me,
14971: As judge, as Mistress too, though, I suspect
14972: You intend it as a kind of test –              9215
14973: Yet, I’ll employ a judge’s first duty,
14974: To give the accused a hearing. Speak out.
14975: 
14976: Lynceus, the Warden of the Tower
14977: 
14978: Let me kneel, and let me see her,
14979: Let me live, or let me die,
14980: Already I’m devoted to her                     9220
14981: Heavenly lady from on high.
14982: 
14983: Waiting for the dawn’s advances,
14984: Gazing at her eastern house,
14985: Suddenly the sunlight dances,
14986: Marvellously in the south!                     9225
14987: 
14988: Drawn to see the marvel closer,
14989: Instead of the ravine and height,
14990: Instead of earth and heaven there,
14991: I gazed at her, the sole delight.
14992: 
14993: I was granted powers of vision                 9230
14994: Like the lynx, high in the tree:
14995: But now I peered in indecision
14996: As in a dark and clouded dream.
14997: 
14998: How think? Even if I’d so wished?
14999: Wall, and tower? Bolted gate?                  9235
15000: Mist, it rose, and cleared the mist,
15001: Came the Goddess here in state!
15002: I surrendered heart and eye
15003: Drinking in the gentle light:
15004: How that beauty blinds, and I                     9240
15005: Was blinded wholly by the sight.
15006: 
15007: I forgot the watchman’s duty,
15008: And the promised trumpet call:
15009: Threaten then, now, to destroy me –
15010: Anger lies in Beauty’s thrall.                    9245
15011: 
15012: Helen
15013: 
15014: I cannot punish this evil that I brought here,
15015: With me. Ah me! What a fierce fate it is
15016: Pursues me, so that everywhere I possess
15017: The hearts of men, and that they neither spare
15018: Themselves nor anything else of worth.            9250
15019: They steal, seduce, fight: rushing to and fro,
15020: Demigods, heroes, gods, even daemons
15021: Led me in my wanderings, here and there.
15022: Alone I’ve confused the world, doubly so:
15023: Now I bring threefold, fourfold woe on woe.       9255
15024: Take this innocent away: let him go.
15025: It’s no shame to be deceived by the gods.
15026: 
15027: Faust
15028: 
15029: O Queen, amazed, I see them both together:
15030: The certain archer, and the stricken prey:
15031: I see the bow, from which the shaft was loosed,   9260
15032: That wounded him. Arrow after arrow,
15033: Now strikes me. Imagining the feathered whirr
15034: Of arrows crossing every court and hall.
15035: What am I now? My walls you make unsafe
15036: My most faithful servants, you make rebels,       9265
15037: Already I fear my army too obeys
15038: A victorious and unconquered lady.
15039: What’s left to do but add myself as well,
15040: And all that I have vainly imagined mine?
15041: Freely and loyally, before your feet,             9270
15042: Let me acknowledge you as Mistress,
15043: Whose presence wins you throne and ownership.
15044: 
15045: Lynceus (Carrying a chest, with men bringing others.)
15046: 
15047: Queen, once more I advance!
15048: The rich man begs a glance,
15049: He sees you and at a glimpse,                           9275
15050: He’s a beggar, and a prince.
15051: 
15052: What am I now? What was I once?
15053: What’s to be willed? What’s to be done?
15054: What use the eye’s clearest sight!
15055: It glances from your royal might.                       9280
15056: 
15057: From the Eastwards we pressed on,
15058: And suddenly the West were gone.
15059: So wide and long the people massed,
15060: The first knew nothing of the last.
15061: 
15062: The first rank fell: the next stood fast,               9285
15063: The third ranks’ lances unsurpassed:
15064: Each man was like a hundredfold,
15065: Thousands died there, all untold.
15066: 
15067: We pressed forwards: we stormed on,
15068: We were masters, then were gone:                        9290
15069: And where I ruled as chief today,
15070: Tomorrow robbed, and stole away.
15071: 
15072: We looked – and rapid was that look:
15073: The loveliest women there we took,
15074: We took the oxen from the stall,                        9295
15075: We took the horses, took them all.
15076: 
15077: But my delight was to discover
15078: The rarest things I could uncover:
15079: And what other men might grasp,
15080: To me was only withered grass.                          9300
15081: I was on the trail of treasure,
15082: Whatever my sharp eye could measure,
15083: In every pocket I could see,
15084: Every chest was glass to me.
15085: 
15086: Heaps of gold, they were mine,            9305
15087: And the noblest gems I’d find:
15088: Yet now the emeralds alone
15089: Are worthy to adorn your throne.
15090: 
15091: Sway there now ‘twixt ear and lip,
15092: You pearly spheres from oceans deep:      9310
15093: A place the rubies dare not seek,
15094: So pale beside your rosy cheek.
15095: 
15096: And so the riches, every prize,
15097: I set down here before your eyes:
15098: Before your feet I gladly yield,          9315
15099: The spoils of many a bloody field.
15100: 
15101: As many chests as I’ve brought you,
15102: I’ve many iron caskets too:
15103: Let me follow your path still
15104: And your treasure chambers fill.          9320
15105: 
15106: You’d scarcely mounted to the throne,
15107: When all bowed down, to you alone,
15108: Wisdom, riches, worldly power,
15109: Before your grace, that very hour.
15110: 
15111: I held it all fast: that is true          9325
15112: But now it’s loosed, and all for you.
15113: I thought its worth was plain to see,
15114: But now it’s nothing much, to me.
15115: 
15116: Everything I’ve owned will pass
15117: From me like mown and withered grass.     9330
15118: O, give me just one brightening glance,
15119: And all the value’s in its dance!
15120: Faust
15121: 
15122: Quickly, remove the heap that boldness won,
15123: And take no blame for it, but seek no praise.
15124: All is hers already, that the castle            9335
15125: Hides in its lap: you offer these few things
15126: In vain. Go and pile treasure on treasure,
15127: In due order. Present a fine array
15128: Of unseen splendours! Let the vaulted halls
15129: Gleam like the clearest sky, let Paradise       9340
15130: Be created from their dead existence.
15131: Quickly let flowery carpet on carpet
15132: Be unrolled beneath her foot: she’ll step
15133: On softest ground: and let her noble gaze,
15134: Blinding all but the Gods, fall on splendour.   9345
15135: 
15136: Lynceus
15137: 
15138: What the lord commands is nothing,
15139: For the servants, a mere plaything:
15140: This exalted beauty rules
15141: Over blood and treasure too.
15142: The whole army now is tamed,                    9350
15143: All the swords are blunt again,
15144: Near this form of noble gold,
15145: The sun itself is pale and cold,
15146: Near the riches of her face
15147: All is but an empty space.                      9355
15148: 
15149: Helen (To Faust.)
15150: 
15151: I wish to speak to you, come here then
15152: Beside me! For the empty place invites
15153: Its lord, and so secures this place for me.
15154: Faust
15155: 
15156: First, let my loyal dedication please you,
15157: While I kneel, noble lady: let me kiss             9360
15158: The gracious hand that lifts me to your side.
15159: Confirm me as co-regent of a realm
15160: Of unknown borders, win now for yourself
15161: Protector, slave, worshipper all in one!
15162: 
15163: Helen
15164: 
15165: So many wonders do I see, and hear                 9365
15166: Amazement grips me, there’s much I would know.
15167: But teach me why that man spoke aloud
15168: With curious speech, familiar but strange.
15169: Each sound seeming to give way to the next,
15170: And when a word gave pleasure to the ear,          9370
15171: Another came, as if to caress the first.
15172: 
15173: Faust
15174: 
15175: If my people’s speech already pleases you,
15176: O, you’ll be delighted with our singing:
15177: It completely satisfies the heart and mind.
15178: But to be sure of it, we’ll practise too:          9375
15179: Alternate speech entices, calls it, forth.
15180: 
15181: Helen
15182: 
15183: You’ll tell me how to speak with lovely art?
15184: 
15185: Faust
15186: 
15187: It’s easy, it must pour forth from the heart.
15188: And if the breast then overflows with yearning,
15189: One looks around and asks –
15190: 
15191: Helen
15192: 
15193:                           - who else is burning.   9380
15194: Faust
15195: 
15196: Not backwards, forwards is the spirit’s sight,
15197: This moment now, alone, –
15198: 
15199: Helen
15200: 
15201:                              - is our delight.
15202: 
15203: Faust
15204: 
15205: She’s treasure and commitment, wealth and land:
15206: What confirmation does she give –
15207: 
15208: Helen
15209: 
15210: 
15211:                                         – my hand.
15212: 
15213: Chorus
15214: 
15215: Who’s offended that our Princess                     9385
15216: Grants the master of the castle
15217: A show of friendliness?
15218: Let’s confess, that we’re as fully
15219: Prisoners, as we’ve been till now
15220: Since the shameful overthrow                         9390
15221: Of Ilium, and the anxious,
15222: Sad, and labyrinthine voyage.
15223: 
15224: Women, used to men’s desires,
15225: Are not particular,
15226: They are proficient.                                 9395
15227: And they award an equal right
15228: To shepherds with their golden hair,
15229: Dark, fauns perhaps, bristling there,
15230: As opportunity affords,
15231: To bodies in their vigour.                           9400
15232: Already they sit closer, closer,
15233: Drawn towards each other,
15234: Shoulder to shoulder, knee to knee,
15235: Hand in hand they sway
15236: Across the thrones’                              9405
15237: Soft cushioned, majesty.
15238: Their private raptures
15239: Revealed so boldly
15240: To the eyes of the people.                       9410
15241: 
15242: Helen
15243: 
15244: I feel so far away and yet so near,
15245: And gladly say now: ‘Here, I am! Here!’
15246: 
15247: Faust
15248: 
15249: I scarcely breathe, I tremble, speech is dead:
15250: This is a dream: time and place have fled.
15251: 
15252: Helen
15253: 
15254: I seem exhausted, yet created new,               9415
15255: Enmeshed with you, the unknown and the true.
15256: 
15257: Faust
15258: 
15259: Don’t seek to analyse so rare a fate!
15260: Our duty is to live: though but a day.
15261: 
15262: Phorkyas (Entering suddenly.)
15263: 
15264: Spell the letters in love’s primer,
15265: Only loving, pass your time here,                9420
15266: Passing, let love be sublime here,
15267: But the moment isn’t right.
15268: Don’t you feel it, this dark presage?
15269: Don’t you hear the trumpet’s message?
15270: Your destruction is in sight.                    9425
15271: Menelaus with his army
15272: Is advancing on you quickly,
15273: Arm yourself, for bitter fight!
15274: Overwhelmed by the winners,
15275: And defiled, like Deiphobus,                                          9430
15276: You’ll all pay, for this delight.
15277: First the lighter vessels shatter,
15278: Then, for this one, at the altar,
15279: The newly sharpened axe shines bright.
15280: 
15281: Faust
15282: 
15283: Rash disturbance! Insistent, she comes pushing in here:               9435
15284: Senseless haste is wrong, even where there’s danger.
15285: Unlucky news makes the fairest messenger ugly:
15286: You, ugliest of all, bring only bad news gladly.
15287: But you’ll not succeed for once: disturb the air
15288: With your empty breath. There’s no danger looming here,               9440
15289: Your danger’s only an idle threat to me.
15290: 
15291: (Calls, and explosions from the towers, trumpets and cornets, martial music.
15292: A powerful army marches past.)
15293: 
15294: No! Now you’ll see the heroes gather,
15295: The whole wide land will here unite:
15296: He deserves the ladies’ favour,
15297: Who, in their defence, shall fight.                                   9445
15298: 
15299: (To the leaders, who step forward from the ranks, and advance.)
15300: 
15301: Rage silently, and do your duty,
15302: Then you’ll achieve the victory,
15303: You, the prime of northern beauty,
15304: You, the flower of the east.
15305: 
15306: Cased in steel, with steel gleaming,                                  9450
15307: The army shatters realms at will,
15308: They appear: the earth is shaking,
15309: They advance, it echoes still.
15310: At Pylos, once, we came to shore,
15311: Old Nestor is no longer living,                                      9455
15312: Our independent army saw
15313: Us shatter all the mighty kings.
15314: 
15315: From these walls, in an instant,
15316: Send Menelaus back to sea:
15317: There robbing, killing, is his errand,                               9460
15318: As is his wish and destiny.
15319: 
15320: Dukes, I greet you every one,
15321: Commanded by the Spartan Queen:
15322: At her feet lay vale and mountain,
15323: Win the kingdoms in between.                                         9465
15324: 
15325: Germans, with your walls and towers,
15326: Defend Corinth and her bays!
15327: Then Achaia’s hundred gorges
15328: I’ll trust to you, the Goths, always.
15329: 
15330: Let the Franks advance on Elis,                                      9470
15331: Messene, to the Saxons brave,
15332: Normans, hold the Argolis,
15333: Rule the shore: and rule the wave.
15334: 
15335: When everyone has his own land,
15336: At foreign foes, let force be aimed,                                 9475
15337: While Sparta holds the high command
15338: Our Queen’s ancestral domain.
15339: 
15340: She’ll behold you each, delighting
15341: In lands, possessed of every right:
15342: And at her feet you’ll seek her blessing,                            9480
15343: Acknowledgement, and law and light.
15344: 
15345: (Faust descends from the throne: the Princes form a circle round him to
15346: receive individual commands and instructions.)
15347: Chorus
15348: 
15349: Who wants the loveliest for himself,
15350: First, above everything,
15351: Would be wise to have weapons about him:
15352: He might well gain by flattery                  9485
15353: Whoever is noblest on Earth:
15354: But he won’t possess her in peace:
15355: The sly, and insidious tempt her from him,
15356: Robbers will boldly steal her from him:
15357: He must prepare to foil them.                   9490
15358: 
15359: So I praise our Prince the while,
15360: And think him nobler than the rest,
15361: Since he combines wisdom and strength,
15362: So that the powerful show obedience,
15363: Waiting his every command.                      9495
15364: They follow his orders faithfully,
15365: Each as much for his own profit
15366: As for the ruler’s reward and thanks,
15367: Winning the highest fame for both.
15368: 
15369: Who now will drag her away                      9500
15370: From the powerful possessor?
15371: She belongs to him: let her be his,
15372: Doubly bestowed by us, so she
15373: And he, are surrounded inside by thick walls,
15374: Outside, by the greatest of armies.             9505
15375: 
15376: Faust
15377: 
15378: The gifts that, on those here, I bestow –
15379: To each of them a prosperous land –
15380: Are great and glorious, let them go!
15381: We in the middle take our stand.
15382: 
15383: In their rivalry they’ll protect you            9510
15384: Half-island ringed by leaping waves,
15385: While these slender hills connect you
15386: To Europe’s last great mountain range.
15387: This land, that outshines every land,
15388: Be blessed for every race forever,                   9515
15389: Delivered to my Queen’s command,
15390: That, long ago now, wondered at her,
15391: 
15392: There, by Eurotas’ whispering light,
15393: She broke radiant from the shell,
15394: That brightness dazzling the sight                   9520
15395: Of siblings: Leda’s eyes, as well.
15396: 
15397: This land now turns to you alone,
15398: Offering you its noblest flower:
15399: Oh, though the whole world is your own,
15400: Let your country hold you in its power!              9525
15401: 
15402: And though you may endure the sun’s cold arrow
15403: Up there, on the mountain’s jagged height,
15404: See, how the rocky hillside’s green below, now,
15405: Where the goat may crop its meagre right.
15406: 
15407: The sources leap, all streams rush down as one,      9530
15408: Gorge, slope, and meadow are already green.
15409: On a hundred hills, rock-folded, steep and broken,
15410: The scattered woolly flocks are clearly seen.
15411: 
15412: Spread all around, with cautious measured stride,
15413: The horned cattle tread the dizzy edge:              9535
15414: But here there’s shelter that the caves provide,
15415: Hundreds to hide them all, on the rocky ledge.
15416: 
15417: Pan guards them too: and lively nymphs live there,
15418: In the damp fresh space of bushy clefts,
15419: And, yearning upward to the higher air,              9540
15420: The crowded tree its slender branches lifts.
15421: Primeval woods! The mighty oaks their cap:
15422: Whose stubborn boughs stick out from them, in state:
15423: While kindly maples, pregnant with sweet sap,
15424: Soar cleanly upward, toying with the weight.           9545
15425: 
15426: Pure mother’s milk, in that still realm of shadows,
15427: Flows rich, in readiness for lamb and child:
15428: Fruit’s not lacking, gift of fertile meadows,
15429: And from the hollow trunk drips honey mild.
15430: 
15431: Here well-being’s granted all the race,                9550
15432: Cheek and lips both to joy consent,
15433: Each one is immortal, in their place:
15434: And all there are healthy and content.
15435: 
15436: And thus the lovely child, of purest days,
15437: Grows, and achieves his father’s strength.             9555
15438: We’re amazed, the question’s still, always:
15439: Are these gods, or are they truly men?
15440: 
15441: When Apollo took a shepherd’s form,
15442: The fairest of them was like the sun:
15443: Since, where pure Nature is the norm,                  9560
15444: Then all the worlds must move as one.
15445: 
15446: (Taking his seat beside her.)
15447: 
15448: So, this have you, and this have I achieved:
15449: Let the past fade behind us: it is gone!
15450: Oh, know yourself from highest gods conceived,
15451: To the first world, alone then, you belong.            9565
15452: 
15453: No solid fortresses shall ring you round!
15454: In eternal youth, stands as it stood –
15455: So our stay with all delight be crowned –
15456: Arcadia in Sparta’s neighbourhood.
15457: Lured here to tread this blessed ground,                               9570
15458: You fled towards a happy destiny!
15459: Let our thrones as arbours now be found,
15460: Our joy be Arcadian, and free!
15461: 
15462: (The scene is completely transformed. Bowers are built against a range of
15463: rocky caverns. A shadowy grove runs to the foot of the rocks that rise on all
15464: sides. Faust and Helen are not visible: the Chorus lie scattered about in
15465: sleep.)
15466: 
15467: Phorkyas
15468: 
15469: I’m not sure how long these women have been sleeping:
15470: Nor do I know whether they allowed themselves                          9575
15471: To dream what I saw clearly with my own eyes.
15472: Therefore I’ll wake them. The young will be amazed,
15473: You bearded ones, too, who sit waiting there, below,
15474: To understand the meaning of these wonders.
15475: Wake! Wake, and shake the dew from your hair,                          9580
15476: The slumber from your eyes! Don’t blink so, but hear me!
15477: 
15478: Chorus
15479: 
15480: Tell us, quickly, quickly, all the wonders that have happened!
15481: If we can’t believe them, we’ll enjoy them with more pleasure.
15482: For we’re wholly weary sitting, staring at these empty stones.
15483: 
15484: Phorkyas
15485: 
15486: You’ve hardly rubbed your eyes, yet you’re already weary, children? 9585
15487: Well, listen: in these caverns, in these grottos, in these arbours,
15488: Shade and shelter have been granted, to the two idyllic lovers,
15489: Our Master and our Mistress.
15490: 
15491: Chorus
15492: 
15493:                           What, within there?
15494: 
15495: Phorkyas
15496:                                                         Sweetly sundered,
15497: From the world, alone they summoned me to grant them quiet service.
15498: At their side I stood there, honoured, yet still, as one who’s trusted, 9590
15499: Always gazed at something other, turning here and there at random.
15500: Looked for roots and bark and mosses, being skilled in all the potions,
15501: And so they were left alone.
15502: 
15503: Chorus
15504: 
15505: You speak as if a whole world’s space were hidden there inside, now,
15506: Woods and fields and lakes and rivers: what a fantasy you spin!      9595
15507: 
15508: Phorkyas
15509: 
15510: It’s true: you’re inexperienced, and its depths are unexplored!
15511: I felt, lost in contemplation, hall on hall there, court on court.
15512: In an instant laughter echoes, through the cavernous recesses:
15513: There I see a boy is springing, from his mother to his father,
15514: From his father to his mother, all is dandling and caressing,            9600
15515: And a foolish, a fond teasing, shouts of play, and cries of joy,
15516: Alternate, there, and I’m deaf.
15517: A naked wingless Spirit, like a faun, and yet no creature,
15518: Leaps across the solid floor, and the ground beneath responding,
15519: Sends him flying through the ether, till the second leap or so, there, 9605
15520: He can touch the cavern roof.
15521: Anxiously his mother’s calling: ‘Leap as often as you like, dear,
15522: But all flying is forbidden, so beware of taking flight.’
15523: And his loyal father warns him: ‘In the earth’s the power of swiftness,
15524: That will quickly send you flying: touch the ground then with your toe, 9610
15525: And like that son of Earth’s, Antaeus, you’ll soon find strength again.’
15526: So he leaps the rocky masses of the cavern, from a cornice,
15527: To another and around then, as a ball does when it’s thrown.
15528: But suddenly he’s vanished in a crevice of the cavern,
15529: And it seems he’s lost. His mother grieves for him, father comforts, 9615
15530: I stand there, wondering anxiously, but there again’s the vision!
15531: Do buried treasures lie there? Robes embroidered all with flowers,
15532: He has fittingly assumed.
15533: Tassels tremble from his shoulders, ribbons flutter round his chest,
15534: In his hand a golden lyre, like a miniature Apollo,                      9620
15535: He steps happily to the overhanging brink: amazing.
15536: And the parents in delight clasp each other to their hearts,
15537: What’s that shining round his temples? It’s hard to see what’s gleaming,
15538: Is it gold and gems, or flames, now, of the spirit’s supreme power?
15539: So he moves as if the stately boy’s proclaimed to us already          9625
15540: The future Lord of Beauty, in whose members the eternal
15541: Melodies are stirring: and so you too will also hear him,
15542: And you too will also see him, with the rarest show of wonder.
15543: 
15544: Chorus
15545: 
15546: Do you call this a marvel,
15547: Crete has begotten?                                                  9630
15548: Can you never have listened
15549: To what Poetry teaches?
15550: Have you never once heard Ionia’s,
15551: Have you never listened to Hellas’
15552: Most ancient of legends                                              9635
15553: Of the gods and heroes?
15554: 
15555: All things that happen
15556: In this present age,
15557: Are mournful echoes
15558: Of our ancestors’ nobler times:                                      9640
15559: And your story can’t equal
15560: That, loveliest of lies,
15561: Easier to believe than Truth,
15562: That they sang of Maia’s son.
15563: 
15564: That delicate and strong, yet                                        9645
15565: Scarcely born, suckling child,
15566: Would you swaddle him in purest down,
15567: Clothe him in costly jewelled bindings,
15568: The crowd of chattering nurses’
15569: Utterly senseless notion.                                            9650
15570: 
15571: But strong and yet delicate,
15572: Already the supple rascal,
15573: Draws forth his lithe body,
15574: Leaves behind that royal,
15575: But timid, constraining shell,                                       9655
15576: Silent, there, in its place:
15577: 
15578: Like the finished butterfly,
15579: From the chilly chrysalis,
15580: Slipping, with quick unfolding wings,
15581: Boldly into the sunlit air,                                         9660
15582: And courageously fluttering.
15583: So did he, the liveliest,
15584: 
15585: And he quickly demonstrated
15586: By the most skilful arts,
15587: That he’d always be the patron                                      9665
15588: Daemon of thieves and jesters
15589: And all seekers of profit.
15590: 
15591: From the Sea God he quickly stole
15592: His trident, and from Ares himself,
15593: Slyly, his sword from its scabbard:                                 9670
15594: Bow and arrows from Phoebus too,
15595: And tongs from Hephaestus:
15596: 
15597: He even stole Father Zeus’
15598: Lightning bolts, not scared of fire:
15599: Then he tripped poor Eros up,                                       9675
15600: In the toils of a wrestling match:
15601: As Venus kissed him, too, stole away,
15602: The ribbons from her breasts.
15603: 
15604: (A pure melodious and exquisite music echoes from the cave. All listen and
15605: appear deeply moved. There is a full musical accompaniment from this point
15606: to the designated pause.)
15607: Phorkyas
15608: 
15609: Hear the loveliest of music,
15610: Free from old mythology!                                         9680
15611: All your gods and all their antics,
15612: Let them go, they’re history.
15613: 
15614: None can understand you more,
15615: We demand a higher art:
15616: From the heart itself must pour,                                 9685
15617: What will influence the heart.
15618: 
15619: (She retires towards the rocks.)
15620: 
15621: Be you stirred, you awesome being,
15622: By the sweet and flattering sound,
15623: We, renewed to life, are feeling,
15624: Moved to tears of joy, around.                                   9690
15625: 
15626: Let the sun be lost from heaven
15627: So it’s daylight in the soul,
15628: We’ll discover in the heart, then,
15629: What the Earth fails to hold.
15630: 
15631: (Helen. Faust. Euphorion, in costume as previously described.)
15632: 
15633: Euphorion
15634: 
15635: Hear the song of childhood sung now,                             9695
15636: Its delight belongs to you,
15637: See me leap about in time, now
15638: Let my parents’ hearts leap too.
15639: 
15640: Helen
15641: 
15642: It requires two noble hearts
15643: For Love to bless humanity,                                      9700
15644: But to be a thing apart
15645: They must make a precious three.
15646: Faust
15647: 
15648: All we sought is now discovered:
15649: I am yours, and you are mine:
15650: And we two are bound together,     9705
15651: There’s no better fate to find.
15652: 
15653: Chorus
15654: 
15655: They’ll delight for many years
15656: In this child’s tender glow,
15657: Ah, this partnership of peers,
15658: How it’s beauty moves me, so!      9710
15659: 
15660: Euphorion
15661: 
15662: Now let me leap, oh,
15663: Now let me spring!
15664: High in the air, go
15665: Circling all things,
15666: That’s the desire                  9715
15667: That’s driving me on.
15668: 
15669: Faust
15670: 
15671: Yet, gently! Gently!
15672: Not into danger,
15673: Lest a chance downfall,
15674: Awaits the ranger,                 9720
15675: Straight away grounds you,
15676: Our darling son!
15677: 
15678: Euphorion
15679: 
15680: I can’t stick fast to
15681: The ground any more:
15682: Let go my hands and                9725
15683: Let go my hair,
15684: Let go my clothes!
15685: They are all mine.
15686: Helen
15687: 
15688: O think! Please think,
15689: Whom you belong to!                                                9730
15690: How it would grieve us,
15691: How you’d destroy too,
15692: That sweet achievement,
15693: Yours, his and mine.
15694: 
15695: Chorus
15696: 
15697: I fear this unity                                                  9735
15698: Soon will unwind!
15699: 
15700: Helen and Faust
15701: 
15702: Calm yourself! Calm excess,
15703: To please your parents,
15704: Too great a liveliness,
15705: Impulsive violence!                                                9740
15706: In rural peacefulness,
15707: Brighten the plain.
15708: 
15709: Euphorion
15710: 
15711: If that’s what you wish, yes,
15712: I’ll stop, I’ll restrain.
15713: 
15714: (He winds, dancing, through the chorus and draws them along with him.)
15715: 
15716: I’ll hover here, lightly                                           9745
15717: Lively the crew.
15718: Is this the melody,
15719: And measure too?
15720: Helen
15721: 
15722: Yes that is neatly done:
15723: Lead all the fairest on,                                              9750
15724: Through intricacy.
15725: 
15726: Faust
15727: 
15728: Would it were over then!
15729: Such entertainment
15730: Won’t delight me.
15731: 
15732: Chorus (With Euphorion, dancing nimbly and singing, in interlinking
15733: ranks.)
15734: 
15735: When your arms equally                                                9755
15736: Are charmingly lifted,
15737: Your curling hair’s brightly
15738: Loosened and shifted.
15739: 
15740: When with a foot so light
15741: Over the earth in flight,                                             9760
15742: Thither and back again,
15743: Step upon step, you rain,
15744: 
15745: Then your goal is in sight,
15746: Loveliest child:
15747: All of our hearts, beguiled,                                          9765
15748: With yours unite.
15749: 
15750: (Pause.)
15751: 
15752: Euphorion
15753: 
15754: You’re like so many
15755: Light-footed fawns:
15756: Now to new games we
15757: Are quickly re-born!                                                  9770
15758: I’ll be the hunter,
15759: You be the prey.
15760: Chorus
15761: 
15762: If you would catch us
15763: Don’t be so eager,
15764: We too are anxious                         9775
15765: When all is over,
15766: To clasp the form,
15767: You so sweetly display!
15768: 
15769: Euphorion
15770: 
15771: Now through the vale!
15772: Up hill and down dale!                     9780
15773: What I gain easily
15774: Is tedious to see,
15775: Only what’s forcibly
15776: Won delights me.
15777: 
15778: Helen and Faust
15779: 
15780: How wild he is now! And how stubborn!      9785
15781: There’s little hope of moderation.
15782: That’s the sound of blowing horns,
15783: Through the woods and valley ringing:
15784: What noise, and what confusion!
15785: 
15786: Chorus (Entering one by one, in haste.)
15787: 
15788: He is running from us swiftly:             9790
15789: Scorning us and always mocking,
15790: Now he drags one from the crowd: she,
15791: The wildest of us all.
15792: 
15793: Euphorion (Dragging along a young girl.)
15794: 
15795: Here I’ll drag the little quarry,
15796: To enforce my wish entirely:               9795
15797: For my joy, and my desire,
15798: Press her wilful heart, on fire,
15799: Kiss her stubborn mouth at length
15800: And proclaim my will and strength.
15801: 
15802: The Girl
15803: 
15804: Let me go! Since there’s a strong                9800
15805: Resistant spirit in this body:
15806: My will, like yours, if I’m not wrong,
15807: Says I’m not taken easily.
15808: 
15809: You think I’m in any danger?
15810: Force of arms is it, you claim!                  9805
15811: Hold me fast, you foolish ranger,
15812: And I’ll scotch your little game.
15813: 
15814: (She turns to flame and flashes into the air.)
15815: 
15816: Follow me through flowing air,
15817: Follow me through caverns bare,
15818: Catch your fleeing prey again!                   9810
15819: 
15820: Euphorion (Shaking off the flames.)
15821: 
15822: Rocks all around me here,
15823: Deep in the forest view,
15824: Make me a prisoner,
15825: Though I’m still young and new.
15826: 
15827: Breezes are blowing fair,                        9815
15828: Waves now are breaking there:
15829: I hear both far away,
15830: I’d gladly be there today.
15831: 
15832: (He leaps further up the rocks.)
15833: 
15834: Helen, Faust and the Chorus
15835: 
15836: A chamois you’d imitate?
15837: We’re fearful of your fate.                      9820
15838: Euphorion
15839: 
15840: Ever higher I must climb.
15841: Ever further I must see.
15842: 
15843: Now I know where I stand!
15844: Amidst this semi-island,
15845: Amidst Pelop’s country,          9825
15846: Earth – kindred to the sea.
15847: 
15848: Chorus
15849: 
15850: Why not live here, in peace,
15851: Among hills and groves?
15852: Vines then for you we’ll seek,   9830
15853: Vines in their rows.
15854: 
15855: Vines on high ridges stand,
15856: Figs, there, and apples gold,
15857: Stay in this lovely land
15858: Stay, and grow old!
15859: 
15860: Euphorion
15861: 
15862: Do you dream of peaceful days?   9835
15863: Dream, then as dreamers may.
15864: War is the watchword though.
15865: Victory! It rings out so.
15866: 
15867: Chorus
15868: 
15869: He who in time of peace
15870: Wishes for war, soon             9840
15871: Witness’s the decease,
15872: Of hope, and fortune.
15873: 
15874: Euphorion
15875: 
15876: Those who made this land,
15877: With danger on every hand,
15878: Free, and courageously,                9845
15879: Gave their blood lavishly:
15880: 
15881: Bring holy meaning
15882: To that sacrifice –
15883: See us still conquering
15884: All whom we fight!                     9850
15885: 
15886: Chorus
15887: 
15888: Look up there, how high he climbs!
15889: Yet he seems to us no smaller:
15890: In his armour, as in triumph,
15891: How he gleams in steel and silver.
15892: 
15893: Euphorion
15894: 
15895: Each one’s no longer conscious         9855
15896: Of the high wall, or the rest:
15897: Since the one enduring fortress,
15898: Is the soldier’s iron breast.
15899: 
15900: If you’d live unconquered,
15901: Quickly arm, and fight the real foe:   9860
15902: Every wife an Amazon bred,
15903: And every child a hero.
15904: 
15905: Chorus
15906: 
15907: Sacred Poetry
15908: Climbing, and heavenly!
15909: Shines there, the fairest star,        9865
15910: Far there, and still so far!
15911: And yet it reaches here,
15912: Always, and still we hear,
15913: Joy, where we are.
15914: Euphorion
15915: 
15916: No, not as a child do I appear,         9870
15917: This youth comes armed, you see:
15918: In spirit he’s already a peer,
15919: Of the strong, the bold, and free.
15920: Now I go!
15921: Now, and lo,                            9875
15922: The path to glory shines for me.
15923: 
15924: Helen and Faust
15925: 
15926: You’ve scarcely been called to being,
15927: Scarcely come to daylight’s gleam,
15928: And from the heights you’re yearning,
15929: For the place of pain, it seems.        9880
15930: Are we two
15931: Naught to you?
15932: Is the sweetest bond a dream?
15933: 
15934: Euphorion
15935: 
15936: Don’t you hear the thundering wave?
15937: Through vale on vale the echoes call,   9885
15938: Host on host, in sand and spray,
15939: Shock on shock, in anguished fall.
15940: Understand
15941: The command
15942: Is death, now and for all.              9890
15943: 
15944: Helen, Faust and the Chorus
15945: 
15946: What horror! What disaster!
15947: Is then death ordained for you?
15948: Euphorion
15949: 
15950: Should I watch it from afar?
15951: No! I’ll share their trouble too.
15952: 
15953: Helen, Faust and the Chorus
15954: 
15955: Exuberance, danger,                                                    9895
15956: Deadliest fate!
15957: 
15958: Euphorion
15959: 
15960: Yes! – I am winged here,
15961: I will not wait!
15962: Onward! I must! I must!
15963: Let me but fly!                                                        9900
15964: 
15965: (He hurls himself into the air: his clothes bear him a moment, his head is
15966: illuminated and a streak of light follows.)
15967: 
15968: Chorus
15969: 
15970: Icarus! Icarus!
15971: No more! We sigh.
15972: 
15973: (A beautiful youth falls at the parents’ feet. We imagine we see a well-known
15974: form in the dead body, but the physical part vanishes at once, while an
15975: aureole rises like a comet to heaven. The clothes, cloak and lyre remain on
15976: the ground.)
15977: 
15978: Helen and Faust
15979: 
15980: At once, joy is followed,
15981: By bitterest pain.
15982: 
15983: Euphorion (From the depths.)
15984: 
15985: Mother, don’t leave me alone,                                          9905
15986: In the shadows’ domain!
15987: (Pause)
15988: 
15989: Chorus (Dirge.)
15990: 
15991: Not alone! – No matter where you are,
15992: For we believe in following you:
15993: Oh! Though from the day you part,
15994: Not one heart will part from you.         9910
15995: We scarcely wish to mourn you, even,
15996: We sing in envy of your fate:
15997: To you the clearest light of heaven,
15998: Gave song and courage, true and great.
15999: 
16000: Ah! You were born for earthly fate,       9915
16001: High descent and supreme power:
16002: Youth, sadly, while you went astray,
16003: Was torn from you in its first hour!
16004: You saw the world, with clearer vision,
16005: You understood the yearning heart,        9920
16006: The glow of lovely woman’s passion,
16007: And all singing’s rarest art.
16008: 
16009: Yet, irresistibly, you ran free,
16010: In nets of indiscipline: you
16011: Divorced yourself violently,              9925
16012: From custom, and from rule:
16013: Until at last, through thinking deeper,
16014: You gave courage greater weight,
16015: And wished to win to splendour,
16016: But that could not be your fate.          9930
16017: 
16018: Whose then? – The gloomy question,
16019: That destiny itself conceals,
16020: While in days unblessed by fortune,
16021: Our people’s silent blood congeals.
16022: But new songs will refresh them,          9935
16023: No longer bow them to the floor,
16024: The earth shall see them once again,
16025: As it saw them once before.
16026: (A complete Pause. The music ends.)
16027: 
16028: Helen (To Faust.)
16029: 
16030: Alas, the ancient word proves true for me, as well:
16031: That joy and beauty never lastingly unite.                             9940
16032: The thread of life, as the thread of love, is torn:
16033: Painfully, lamenting both, I must say: farewell,
16034: And enter your embrace, once, and then no more.
16035: Persephone, receive me, and this child of ours!
16036: 
16037: (She embraces Faust: her body vanishes, her dress and veil remain in his
16038: hands.)
16039: 
16040: Phorkyas (To Faust.)
16041: 
16042: Hold tight to what alone remains to you.                               9945
16043: Don’t let the garment go. Already, daemons
16044: Pull at its hem, and wish to drag it down
16045: Into the Underworld. Hold tight to it, now!
16046: It no longer veils the divinity you’ve lost,
16047: But it is divine. Employ then the priceless,                           9950
16048: Noble gift for yourself, and soar on high:
16049: It will carry you quickly from the lowest
16050: To the highest ether, while you can endure.
16051: We’ll meet once more, far away from here.
16052: 
16053: (Helen’s garments dissolve in mist, surround Faust, life him into the air, and
16054: drift away with him.)
16055: 
16056: (Phorkyas takes Euphorion’s tunic, cloak and lyre from the ground, steps
16057: forward to the proscenium, holds them aloft and speaks.)
16058: 
16059: As always, I’ve discovered something good!                             9955
16060: The flame itself has gone, that’s understood,
16061: Yet, for the world, I can’t be truly sad.
16062: Here’s enough to fuel the poets’ regiment,
16063: Stir their guild to envy, make them mad,
16064: And if I still can’t lend them any talent,                             9960
16065: At least I’ll have a costume for the lad.
16066: (She seats herself on a low column in the proscenium.)
16067: 
16068: Panthalis
16069: 
16070: Quick now, girls! We’re all free of the magic now,
16071: That old Thessalian woman’s enthralling spell,
16072: That jangling dizziness of confusing sound,
16073: Troubling the ear, and more the inner sense.             9965
16074: Down to Hades! Since with solemn step the Queen
16075: Descended swiftly. Let her faithful servants’
16076: Footsteps follow her downward path without delay.
16077: We’ll find her beside the Unfathomable Throne.
16078: 
16079: Chorus
16080: 
16081: Of course, queens are happy anywhere:                    9970
16082: Even in Hades they’re on top,
16083: Associating proudly with their peers,
16084: Persephone’s intimate company.
16085: But for us, then, in the background,
16086: Of the asphodel-meadowed depths,                         9975
16087: With their long rows of poplars,
16088: Their fruitless crowds of willows,
16089: What fun is there for us,
16090: Piping like bats at twilight,
16091: In cheerless, ghostly whispers?                          9980
16092: 
16093: Panthalis
16094: 
16095: Who wins no name, and wills no noble work,
16096: Belongs to the elements: so away with you!
16097: My own intense desire’s to be with my Queen,
16098: The individual’s loyalty and not just service.
16099: 
16100: (Exits.)
16101: 
16102: All
16103: 
16104: We’re returned to the light of day,                      9985
16105: No longer individual, it’s true,
16106: We feel it, and we know it,
16107: But we’ll never go back to Hades.
16108: Ever-living Nature,
16109: Makes the most valid claim                                             9990
16110: On our spirits, and we on her.
16111: 
16112: A Section of the Chorus
16113: 
16114: We in all the thousand branches’ whispering tremors, swaying murmurs,
16115: Sweetly rocked, will lightly draw the root-born founts of being upwards,
16116: To the twigs: and now with leaves, and now with the exuberant blossom,
16117: We’ll adorn their floating tresses, freely thriving in the breezes.     9995
16118: Straight away, now, as the fruit falls, happy crowds and flocks will gather,
16119: For the picking and the tasting, swift-arriving, busy-thronging:
16120: Bending down, now, all around us, as before the early gods.
16121: 
16122: A Second Section of the Chorus
16123: 
16124: We, against the rocky cliff face, by the smooth far-gleaming mirror,
16125: We will nestle, softly moving, in the gentle waves that flatter:       10000
16126: Listening, hearing every echo, birdsong, now, or reedy fluting,
16127: To the fearful voice of Pan, too, we’ll provide a ready answer:
16128: To the murmuring, send a murmur: to the thunder roll our thunder,
16129: In earth-shaking repetition, in threefold, or tenfold echo.
16130: 
16131: A Third Section of the Chorus
16132: 
16133: Sisters! We, of nimbler senses, hurry onwards with the waters:         10005
16134: For the richly covered, far-off, mountain ranges each entice us.
16135: Ever deeper, ever downward, in meandering curves we’ll water
16136: First the meadows, then the pastures, then the house and the garden,
16137: Where the slender tips of cypress, over banks and watery mirror,
16138: Over all the landscape, mark it, soaring skywards in the air.          10010
16139: 
16140: A Fourth Section of the Chorus
16141: 
16142: Wander where you please, you others: we will circle, we will rustle
16143: Round the densely planted hillside, where the vine stock’s growing green:
16144: There, each day, we’ll pay attention to the cultivator’s passion,
16145: Watch his diligence and care, there: watch for its uncertain outcome.
16146: How he hoes, how he digs there, how he heaps, and prunes, and ties, 10015
16147: Prays to all the gods above him, most of all prays to the sun god.
16148: The effeminate one, Bacchus, gives scant thought to faithful servants,
16149: Rests in arbours, lolls in caverns, flirting with the youngest Faun.
16150: Whatsoever he might need there, for his half-befuddled dreaming,
16151: Is left for him in wineskins, stored around in jars and vessels,        10020
16152: Right and left, in cool recesses, gathered through the endless ages.
16153: But when the gods, that’s Helios we mean before all others,
16154: Cooling, wetting, warming, heating, fill the vineyard’s horn of plenty,
16155: Where the silent grower laboured, suddenly it’s all enlivened,
16156: And in every leaf there’s rustling, rustling now from vine to vine.     10025
16157: Baskets creaking, buckets rattling, the tubs are carried groaning,
16158: All towards enormous vats there, to the lusty treaders’ dance:
16159: So, then, all the sacred bounty, of the pure bred juicy harvest,
16160: Fiercely trodden, spurting, foaming, mingled there, is crudely squashed.
16161: Now the cymbals’ brazen clamour’s ringing boldly in our ears,           10030
16162: As Dionysus from his Mysteries is unveiled, and is revealed:
16163: Here with his goat-foot Satyrs, whirling goat-foot Satyresses,
16164: And Silenus’s, unruly, long-eared ass, that brays amongst them.
16165: Nothing’s spared! The cloven feet now, trample on all decency:
16166: All the senses whirl, bewildered: hideously, ears are stunned, there. 10035
16167: Drunkards fumble for their wine-cups, head and bellies over-full,
16168: Here and there one has misgivings, but can only swell the riot,
16169: Since to hold the latest vintage, one must drain the oldest skin!
16170: 
16171: (The curtain falls. Phorkyas in the proscenium rises to full height, steps
16172: down from her tragic buskins, removes her mask and veil, and reveals
16173: herself as Mephistopheles, to point the last lines, by way of epilogue.)
16174: Part II Act IV Scene I: High Mountains
16175: 
16176: (Fierce, jagged rocky peaks. A cloud approaches, pauses and settles on a
16177: projecting ledge. It parts.)
16178: 
16179: Faust (Steps out.)
16180: 
16181: Gazing at those deep solitudes beneath my feet,
16182: I tread the mountain brink with deliberation,                        10040
16183: Leaving the cloud-vehicle that carried me,
16184: Softly, through bright day, over land and ocean.
16185: Slowly, not dispersing, now, it moves away.
16186: With a rolling movement, travelling eastward,
16187: And the eye follows in wondering admiration.                         10045
16188: Moving it divides, wave-like and changeable.
16189: Yet it shapes itself – My eyes can’t deceive me! –
16190: I see, reclining there, nobly, on sunlit pillows,
16191: A godlike female form, though it’s immense!
16192: An image of Juno, Leda, or Helen herself,                            10050
16193: Royally lovely, floating before my eyes.
16194: Ah! It’s already melting! Formlessly huge
16195: And towering it hangs in far icy eastern hills,
16196: Reflecting deep meaning from fine fleeting days.
16197: Yet a soft, delicate band of mist still clings                       10055
16198: To head and body, coolly caressing: and cheers me.
16199: Now it lifts lightly, soars higher and higher, there,
16200: Condensing. Does its enticing shape deceive me,
16201: Like some long-forgotten joy of earliest youth?
16202: The first riches of the heart’s depths flow again:                   10060
16203: I’d liken it to Aurora’s Love, light-winged:
16204: The first, swiftly felt, scarcely understood glance,
16205: That outshines every treasure when it’s held fast.
16206: The lovely form rises, now, like spiritual beauty,
16207: Not melting further, but lifting through the air,                    10065
16208: And carries, far-off, the best of what I am.
16209: 
16210: (A seven-league boot strides forward: another follows immediately.
16211: Mephistopheles steps out of them. The boots stride off quickly.)
16212: 
16213: Now that I call real onward striding!
16214: But tell me why you’re all alone,
16215: Climbing here among the horrors,
16216: In these horrendous gulfs of stone?                     10070
16217: I know them well, but with another face,
16218: In truth, the floor of Hell’s a similar place.
16219: 
16220: Faust
16221: 
16222: You’re never short of a foolish fantasy:
16223: You’ve dusted that one off again I see.
16224: 
16225: Mephistopheles (Seriously)
16226: 
16227: When the Lord God – and I know why as well –            10075
16228: Banished us from the air to deepest deeps,
16229: There, where round and round the glow of Hell,
16230: An eternal inward self-fuelled fire leaps,
16231: We found we were too brightly illuminated,
16232: Quite crowded, and uncomfortably situated.              10080
16233: All the devils fell to fits of coughing,
16234: The vents above them and beneath them puffing,
16235: Hell swollen with the sulphur’s stench and acid,
16236: Gave out its gas! The bubble was so massive,
16237: That soon the level surface of the earth,               10085
16238: Thick as it was, was forced to crack and burst.
16239: So we all gained another mountain from it,
16240: And what was ground, before, now is summit.
16241: From this they deduced the truest law,
16242: Turn lowest into highest, to be sure,                   10090
16243: Since we escaped from fiery prison there,
16244: To excessive power in the freer air:
16245: An open mystery, yet well concealed,
16246: And only lately publicly revealed. (Ephesians vi:xii)
16247: Faust
16248: 
16249: To me the mountain masses are nobly dumb,                 10095
16250: I don’t ask why they are, or where they’re from.
16251: When Nature in herself was grounded
16252: The ball of Earth she neatly rounded,
16253: Delighting in the mountains and the deep,
16254: Setting rock on rock, and peak on peak,                   10100
16255: Sloping the hills conveniently downward,
16256: Softening them to vales, gently bounded.
16257: They grow green, and joyfully she ranges,
16258: Without the need for any violent changes.
16259: 
16260: Mephistopheles
16261: 
16262: Yes, so you say! It’s clear as day to you:                10105
16263: But he knows otherwise who saw it too.
16264: I was there, while the void seethed below,
16265: Enduring all that swollen, fiery tide:
16266: When Moloch’s hammer forged cliffs, at a blow,
16267: And flung the ruined mountains, far and wide.             10110
16268: Those foreign boulders scattered through the land:
16269: Who knows what forces left them high and dry?
16270: Philosophers all have failed to understand,
16271: The rocks are there, and we must let them stand,
16272: We’ve damaged them, already, where they lie.              10115
16273: Only the true believers, the people, know,
16274: And nothing will shake their fond opinion,
16275: They, since their wisdom ripened long ago,
16276: Say it’s due to Satan’s wonderful dominion.
16277: The traveller climbs, with faith’s crutch, over ridges,   10120
16278: Across the Devil’s rocks, and Devil’s bridges.
16279: 
16280: Faust
16281: 
16282: Yet it’s still worth noting, since every feature,
16283: Reveals what it is the Devil sees in Nature.
16284: Mephistopheles
16285: 
16286: What’s that to me! Let Nature be what she is!
16287: The Devil was there: that’s what I’d have you notice!               10125
16288: We’re the folk, you see, who achieve great things:
16289: The signs are tumult, force, and what nonsense brings! –
16290: But shall I make myself understood at last: it’s best:
16291: Did nothing at all of ours please you in the slightest?
16292: You’ve looked down, from immeasurable heights,                      10130
16293: On the riches of the world, and its splendid sights. (Matthew iv)
16294: Yet, hard as you may be to fire,
16295: Didn’t you feel some deep desire?
16296: 
16297: Faust
16298: 
16299: I did! I saw a mighty plan.
16300: Guess!
16301: 
16302: Mephistopheles
16303: 
16304:             Oh, that’s easily done.                                 10135
16305: I’d find myself some capital city,
16306: It’s core the citizens’ greedy plenty,
16307: Crooked alleys and pointed gables,
16308: Cabbage, turnips, onions, market tables:
16309: Butcher’s stalls where flies all cluster:                           10140
16310: Round the fattened joints, pass muster:
16311: Wherever you move, there you’ll find
16312: Stench and activity, intertwined.
16313: Then wide streets, and wider squares,
16314: Measured, elegant thoroughfares:                                    10145
16315: And, at their end, no gates to bar you:
16316: Just boundless far-flung suburbs too.
16317: There I love to see all the carriages go by,
16318: The noisy rushing about from side to side,
16319: The endless running to and fro,                                     10150
16320: Of scattered ants in ceaseless flow.
16321: And when I walk, and when I ride,
16322: I’d be the central point implied,
16323: A hundred thousand honouring me.
16324: Faust
16325: 
16326: That could never content me though.               10155
16327: A swelling crowd is fine to see,
16328: All well-fed in their way, agreed,
16329: Well-bred, well-taught, all the three –
16330: Yet you’ve only made more rebels grow.
16331: 
16332: Mephistopheles
16333: 
16334: For myself, I’d deliberately create               10160
16335: A pleasure house in a pleasant place.
16336: Woods, hills, fields, meadows, open ground,
16337: With splendid gardens all around.
16338: Between green walls of velvet leaves,
16339: Straight walks, where artful shadows please,      10165
16340: Waterfalls, spanning the rocks, in pairs,
16341: And all those kinds of water-jet affairs:
16342: Rising nobly, while all round the dish,
16343: A thousand little fountains hiss and piss.
16344: Then I’d have a hut, snug and convenient,         10170
16345: Where beautiful women might be content:
16346: And pass the boundless time away
16347: In the sweetest solitude, and play.
16348: Women, I say: since, one and all,
16349: I think of their loveliness in the plural.        10175
16350: 
16351: Faust
16352: 
16353: Sardanapalus! Modern and rural!
16354: 
16355: Mephistopheles
16356: 
16357: Then might one ask to know your yearning?
16358: It’s something daring: I’ve no doubt.
16359: Since the moon was near you in your journeying,
16360: Might it be moon-madness you’re about?            10180
16361: Faust
16362: 
16363: Not at all! This earthly round
16364: Grants space for some mighty thing.
16365: We’ll attempt what’s astonishing,
16366: New strength for daring work I’ve found.
16367: 
16368: Mephistopheles
16369: 
16370: And shall you earn more glory by it too?           10185
16371: One sees the heroines have been with you.
16372: 
16373: Faust
16374: 
16375: I’ll win power, and property!
16376: The deed is all, and not the glory.
16377: 
16378: Mephistopheles
16379: 
16380: Yet future poets’ verse will stress
16381: The splendour of your bright success,              10190
16382: And inspire fools to foolishness.
16383: 
16384: Faust
16385: 
16386: All that’s far from you, indeed.
16387: What do you know of what Men need?
16388: Your contrary being, bitter, dire,
16389: What does it know of Man’s desire?                 10195
16390: 
16391: Mephistopheles
16392: 
16393: Let it all be as you wish it then!
16394: Trust fancy’s flight to me again.
16395: 
16396: Faust
16397: 
16398: My eyes were drawn towards the deepest ocean:
16399: It swelled, and heaped itself, upon itself,
16400: Then ebbed, and shook its waves again in motion,   10200
16401: Storming towards the wide shore’s level shelf.
16402: And that annoyed me: as the exuberance
16403: Of a free spirit, that values all its rights,
16404: Will transmit uneasy feelings to the dance
16405: Of the passionate blood that it excites.             10205
16406: I thought it chance: I gazed more intensely:
16407: The waves paused, rolled away from me,
16408: Far from what they’d reached in their pride:
16409: Time passes, and then once more comes the tide.
16410: 
16411: Mephistopheles (To the audience.)
16412: 
16413: There’s nothing new in that to greet my ears,        10210
16414: I’ve known it for a hundred thousand years.
16415: 
16416: Faust (Continuing passionately.)
16417: 
16418: It sweeps along, to whatever thousand ends:
16419: Fruitless itself, it fruitlessly extends:
16420: It swells and rolls and breaks and overwhelms
16421: The empty stretches of its barren realms.            10215
16422: There wave rules power-inspired wave, again
16423: Draws back – and yet still there’s nothing gained.
16424: If anything makes me despair, of my intent,
16425: It’s the aimless force of that wild element!
16426: Then my spirit dared to soar high above:             10220
16427: Here I must fight, and this I must remove.
16428: And it’s possible! – However tides may flow,
16429: At last they nestle round the hills below:
16430: So they are tamed in their exuberance,
16431: A modest height tops their proud advance,            10225
16432: A modest depth draws them forcefully on.
16433: Quick, through my mind, leapt plan after plan:
16434: Let rich enjoyment be mine for evermore,
16435: To keep the noble ocean from the shore,
16436: To channel all the wide and watery waste,            10230
16437: And urge it backwards to its own deep place.
16438: Step by step I know how to design it:
16439: That’s my desire, so be brave and promote it!
16440: (On the right, from the distance, behind the audience, the sound of drums
16441: and military music.)
16442: 
16443: Mephistopheles
16444: 
16445: That’s trivial! Can you hear the distant drums?
16446: 
16447: Faust
16448: 
16449: War again! The wise man hates it when it comes.                       10235
16450: 
16451: Mephistopheles
16452: 
16453: War or peace, it’s wise to seize the chance,
16454: And gain advantage from the circumstance.
16455: One waits, one notes each favourable moment.
16456: Opportunity’s about, so Faust, be ardent!
16457: 
16458: Faust
16459: 
16460: Spare me all your riddles, if you please!                             10240
16461: Once and for all, say, what am I to seize?
16462: 
16463: Mephistopheles
16464: 
16465: Nothing was hidden from me on my journey:
16466: The noble Emperor’s consumed by worry.
16467: You know him. While we both supplied him,
16468: Those illusory riches in his hand, beside him,                        10245
16469: The whole world then was open to him.
16470: Young, the throne was granted to him,
16471: And it pleased him to assume, wrongly,
16472: That he could easily combine the two,
16473: Enjoy the essential and the lovely too:                               10250
16474: Both government and pleasure, jointly.
16475: 
16476: Faust
16477: 
16478: A fatal error! He who wishes to command
16479: Must make command his joy, and though
16480: His mind is full of all the noblest plans,
16481: What he intends, must let no other know.             10255
16482: What he whispers then in some faithful ear,
16483: Is done, and the world will be amazed to hear.
16484: So he’ll remain supreme, above them all,
16485: And noblest: pleasure comes before a fall.
16486: 
16487: Mephistopheles
16488: 
16489: That’s not the man! He enjoyed himself, and how!     10260
16490: Meanwhile anarchy brought the empire down,
16491: While great fought little, and orders crossed,
16492: And brothers fought with brothers, and were lost,
16493: Castle with castle, city against city,
16494: The guilds at war with the nobility:                 10265
16495: The bishops with their congregation:
16496: No friends, and only a hostile nation.
16497: In churches death and slaughter: through the gate
16498: Every merchant and trader swift to his fate.
16499: Now, everywhere, man’s audacity shows:               10270
16500: The word is ‘defend your life’. And so it goes.
16501: 
16502: Faust
16503: 
16504: So it goes – it stumbles, falls, and stands again,
16505: Then tumbles headlong, and lies there in pain.
16506: 
16507: Mephistopheles
16508: 
16509: None dared to criticise the situation,
16510: Each could, and would improve his station.           10275
16511: Even the smallest wished to be great enough.
16512: But for the best it proved a step too much.
16513: The capable declared, with energy:
16514: ‘He who brings peace can have the mastery.
16515: The Emperor can’t, and will not – let us choose      10280
16516: A new Emperor, who’ll inspire the realm anew.
16517: While each man achieves security,
16518: In a world that’s re-created freshly,
16519: Let peace and justice there be wedded, too.’
16520: Faust
16521: 
16522: That smacks of priesthood.                                             10285
16523: 
16524: Mephistopheles
16525:                     The priests were there, yes,
16526: Defending their well-fed stomachs with the rest,
16527: And they were more involved than all the others.
16528: The rebels swarmed: and were blessed as brothers:
16529: Then the Emperor, whom we had made happy,
16530: Advanced, for his last battle, that’s as maybe.                        10290
16531: 
16532: Faust
16533: 
16534: I’m sorry for him: He was so frank and open.
16535: 
16536: Mephistopheles
16537: 
16538: We’ll watch! While there’s life there’s hope again.
16539: Let’s set him free, from this narrow valley!
16540: He’s a thousand times saved, if they would rally.
16541: Who knows how the dice might fall, if so:                              10295
16542: Good luck, and he’ll have treasures to bestow.
16543: 
16544: (They cross over the middle range of hills, and view the army in the valley.
16545: Drums and military music sound from below.)
16546: 
16547: The position they’ve taken, there, looks fine:
16548: We’ll join them: victory – in the nick of time.
16549: 
16550: Faust
16551: 
16552: And what should I expect to see?
16553: A hollow show! Blind magic! Trickery!                                  10300
16554: Mephistopheles
16555: 
16556: Strategy, and how to win a battle!
16557: Think hard, and be on your mettle,
16558: Keep dreaming of your mighty aim.
16559: If we return the Emperor his land,
16560: You can kneel, and make a claim,             10305
16561: In payment, for the boundless strand.
16562: 
16563: Faust
16564: 
16565: You’ve managed all the other things,
16566: So win the battle, and what it brings!
16567: 
16568: Mephistopheles
16569: 
16570: No, you’ll win it! There, beneath,
16571: You’ll be their commander-in-chief.          10310
16572: 
16573: Faust
16574: 
16575: That’s a somewhat glorified position:
16576: Knowing nothing, to command the mission!
16577: 
16578: Mephistopheles
16579: 
16580: Leave it to the General Staff to care,
16581: And see a Field-Marshall newborn there.
16582: I know all about Un-Councils of War          10315
16583: Form your War Council, quickly, therefore,
16584: From ancient hills’ ancient human power:
16585: Bless those who can pile peaks in a tower.
16586: 
16587: Faust
16588: 
16589: What do I see, what warriors approach?
16590: Have you truly roused the mountain folk?     10320
16591: Mephistopheles
16592: 
16593: No! But like Shakespeare’s Peter Quince,
16594: I’ve picked the very best of what there is.
16595: 
16596: (The Three Mighty Warriors appear.)
16597: 
16598: Here are my lads arriving now!
16599: You see they’re all of different ages,
16600: And clothes and armour too: allow                     10325
16601: That you’ll be fine when battle rages.
16602: 
16603: (To the audience.)
16604: 
16605: Every child today loves to see
16606: Knights in armour take the floor:
16607: Allegorical though they may be,
16608: They’ll delight them all the more.                    10330
16609: 
16610: Bullyboy (Young, lightly armed, plainly clothed.)
16611: 
16612: If someone meets me face to face,
16613: I’ll shake a fist right there in his ugly mug,
16614: And when the yellow-belly runs away,
16615: I’ll grasp his hair, and give a nasty tug.
16616: 
16617: Grab-quick (Mature, well-armed, richly dressed.)
16618: 
16619: Such idle brawling’s foolishness,                     10335
16620: That’s how to ruin the day:
16621: Don’t be slow first to possess,
16622: Then afterwards you’ll get your way.
16623: 
16624: Hold-tight (Older, heavily armed, without a cloak.)
16625: 
16626: But that’s the path where little’s won!
16627: Great possession’s quickly gone,                      10340
16628: Vanishing in the stream of life.
16629: It’s fine to take, but best to hold:
16630: Let grey hairs command the bold,
16631: And you’ll lose nothing in the strife.
16632: Part II Act IV Scene II: On the Headland
16633: 
16634: (Drums and military music from below. The Emperor’s tent is pitched.)
16635: 
16636: (The Emperor, Commander-in-Chief, Guardsmen.)
16637: 
16638: The Commander-in-Chief
16639: 
16640: It still seems the most likely strategy,                            10345
16641: To have made our whole army wait,
16642: Here below, in this convenient valley:
16643: I hope the choice is truly fortunate.
16644: 
16645: The Emperor
16646: 
16647: Whatever will happen now, we’ll soon see:
16648: But I don’t like this half-retreat, it’s weak.                      10350
16649: 
16650: The Commander-in-Chief
16651: 
16652: Look here, my Prince, on our right flank!
16653: This terrain is one that Generals like to thank:
16654: The hills aren’t steep, but there’s no ready access,
16655: So it protects us, while denying them success:
16656: We’re half-concealed, on undulating ground:                         10355
16657: Their cavalry won’t dare to circle round.
16658: 
16659: The Emperor
16660: 
16661: There’s nothing left for me to do, but praise:
16662: Here strength and bravery may have their day.
16663: 
16664: The Commander-in-Chief
16665: 
16666: There, in the centre of the level space,
16667: See the phalanx, eagerly in place.                                  10360
16668: The lances shine and glitter in the air,
16669: Through the sunlit mist of morning, there.
16670: And all the mighty square is swaying darkly!
16671: Thousands inspired to fierce activity.
16672: There you can see our power en masse,                     10365
16673: I trust it to split the enemy in half.
16674: 
16675: The Emperor
16676: 
16677: This is the first time I’ve ever gazed on such a sight.
16678: Forces like these are worth double when they fight.
16679: 
16680: The Commander-in-Chief
16681: 
16682: I’ve nothing to report about our left,
16683: Valiant heroes hold the rocky cleft,                      10370
16684: Weapons gleam across the rocky dale,
16685: A vital pass protects the narrow vale.
16686: Here the enemy power, I think, will shatter,
16687: Taken unawares in this bloody matter.
16688: 
16689: The Emperor
16690: 
16691: There they advance, my faithless kith and kin,            10375
16692: Even as they call me brother, uncle, cousin,
16693: Ever more widely, allowing men’s respect
16694: For throne and sceptre to fall into neglect:
16695: Ruining the empire with their fighting,
16696: And now, against me, rebelliously uniting.                10380
16697: The mob is swayed, uncertain in its mind,
16698: Then, wherever the stream flows, flows behind.
16699: 
16700: The Commander-in-Chief
16701: 
16702: A faithful soldier hastens towards us, look,
16703: One sent for news, perhaps he’s had some luck!
16704: 
16705: First Scout
16706: 
16707: Luckily we met success,                                   10385
16708: Brave and cunning in our skill,
16709: Probing, out to east and west,
16710: Yet bring you bad news, still.
16711: Many swear their loyalty,
16712: Many a faithful company:                                   10390
16713: Yet all idly apologetic:
16714: Quailing inwardly, apathetic.
16715: 
16716: The Emperor
16717: 
16718: From selfishness they learn self-preservation,
16719: Not honour, affection, gratitude, dedication.
16720: No one thinks that when time brings the reckoning,         10395
16721: The neighbour’s house ignites theirs while it’s burning.
16722: 
16723: The Commander-in-Chief
16724: 
16725: The second scout’s approaching, slowly,
16726: On stumbling legs: a man full weary.
16727: 
16728: Second Scout
16729: 
16730: At first we easily detected
16731: The nature of their wild plan:                             10400
16732: Then, suddenly, and unexpected,
16733: A second Emperor was at hand.
16734: And in a calm, and orderly manner
16735: Withdrew the army from the deep:
16736: Unfurling his deceitful banner:                            10405
16737: They all followed him, like sheep!
16738: 
16739: The Emperor
16740: 
16741: A second Emperor’s fortunate for me:
16742: Since I’m the Emperor, plain as plain can be.
16743: Now as a soldier I’ll dress myself, again,
16744: In armour, dedicated to this higher aim.                   10410
16745: My entertainments, fine as they all were,
16746: Lacking in nothing, never brought me danger.
16747: While you suggested something innocent,
16748: My heart longed to fight the tournament:
16749: And had you not dissuaded me from war,                     10415
16750: I’d have shone in glorious deeds before.
16751: But when I was mirrored in that realm of fire,
16752: I felt my heart was mine, and made entire:
16753: The fierce element entered in my fate,
16754: Only a dream, and yet the dream was great.                            10420
16755: I’ve thought confusedly of fame and glory:
16756: Yet all was my own neglect, an evil story.
16757: 
16758: (The heralds are sent to challenge the rival Emperor to single combat.)
16759: 
16760: (Faust enters, in armour, with half-closed visor. The Three Mighty Warriors
16761: appear armed and dressed as previously described.)
16762: 
16763: Faust
16764: 
16765: We’re here, and hope our presence is accepted:
16766: Though needless, caution’s often well respected.
16767: You know how hill-folk consider and explore:                          10425
16768: They study nature and the mountains’ lore.
16769: The spirits drawn from out the level valley,
16770: Are happier than ever in the wide hill-country.
16771: They still work the labyrinthine masses,
16772: Among metallic fumes of noble gases.                                  10430
16773: Intent on separating, proving, blending,
16774: Their only aim some innovative finding.
16775: With gentle touch and spiritual power,
16776: They build transparent forms, by the hour:
16777: Then in eternal silence, in the crystal,                              10435
16778: They watch the destiny of all things mortal.
16779: 
16780: The Emperor
16781: 
16782: I’ve heard it said: and I believe it’s true:
16783: But, gallant soldier, what’s all that to you?
16784: 
16785: Faust
16786: 
16787: Your true and honourable servant there,
16788: Is that Sabine, the Norcian Necromancer.                              10440
16789: What fearful fate once hung above his head!
16790: Crackling wood, the stinging fire ahead:
16791: Dry timber packed already round his feet,
16792: With rolls of pitch and brimstone all complete:
16793: No warrior, god, or devil to the rescue,               10445
16794: The Emperor saved his life: and that was you,
16795: In Rome: he was obliged, and none the less
16796: Anxiously, he contemplates your progress.
16797: Wholly forgotten: every hour, just for you,
16798: He studies the stars and the abyss too.                10450
16799: He sent us on, by the swiftest path,
16800: To help you. Great is the mountain craft:
16801: There Nature works omnipotent, and free,
16802: Though foolish clerics call it wizardry.
16803: 
16804: The Emperor
16805: 
16806: On joyful days, when we greet our guests,              10455
16807: Who gather pleasantly, with happy jests,
16808: It gives us pleasure, when they pull and push,
16809: And fill the halls and chambers with their crush.
16810: Yet the brave man meets with noblest welcome,
16811: When in fierce support he deigns to come,              10460
16812: At the dawning of some perilous day,
16813: When fate’s balance holds us in its sway.
16814: Yet while some time this moment can afford,
16815: Hold back your strong hand from the eager sword,
16816: Honour the instant, when thousands march,              10465
16817: For or against me, taking up the torch.
16818: Self’s the Man! Who claims the crown and throne,
16819: Must be worthy of the honour, on his own.
16820: May the phantom now that stands against me,
16821: Who calls himself the Emperor of my country,           10470
16822: The army’s leader, and the lords’ crowned head,
16823: Be hurled by my own fist among the dead.
16824: 
16825: Faust
16826: 
16827: Whatever the need to finish what you’ve started,
16828: It would go ill if you and your head were parted.
16829: Isn’t your helmet decked with plume and crest?         10475
16830: It shields the head that fills our hearts with zest.
16831: Without a head what can the members do?
16832: If it should sleep, they sink in silence too:
16833: If it’s injured, they’re all hurt alike,
16834: And if it’s healed they quickly stir to life.    10480
16835: Swiftly the arm will assert its right:
16836: And shield the head then from the fight:
16837: The sword at once perceives its duty,
16838: Strikes again, and parries strongly:
16839: The brave foot, owning its luck again,           10485
16840: Plants itself on the necks of the slain.
16841: 
16842: The Emperor
16843: 
16844: Such is my wrath, that’s how I’d use the fool,
16845: And set his head in front of me, for a stool.
16846: 
16847: Heralds (Returning.)
16848: 
16849: Our advances they reject,
16850: With little honour, or respect.                  10490
16851: Our strong, and noble ultimatum,
16852: They treated as an empty statement:
16853: ‘Your Emperor is wholly lost,
16854: An echo of some ancient rhyme:
16855: When we think about the past,                    10495
16856: His tale will be: Once upon a time.’
16857: 
16858: Faust
16859: 
16860: It’s come to pass as the best of men demand,
16861: Those firm and true, at your right hand:
16862: There is the foe: your men stand by us:
16863: Order the advance, the time’s propitious.        10500
16864: 
16865: The Emperor
16866: 
16867: I hereby relinquish the command.
16868: 
16869: (To the Commander-In-Chief)
16870: Prince, I entrust the duty to your hand.
16871: 
16872: The Commander-in-Chief
16873: 
16874: Then let the right wing start its assault!
16875: The enemy left’s ascending, even now,
16876: And in a moment will be forced to halt.           10505
16877: To our young faithfuls they will have to bow.
16878: 
16879: Faust
16880: 
16881: Let this brave hero, straight away,
16882: Join your ranks, without delay,
16883: So that in your ranks he might,
16884: Make a brave show in the fight.                   10510
16885: 
16886: (He points to the Mighty Warrior on the right.)
16887: 
16888: Bully-Boy (Coming forward.)
16889: 
16890: He who shows his face to me, won’t turn
16891: Before his front and back teeth shatter:
16892: He who shows his back to me will earn
16893: A blow to make his head much flatter.
16894: And if your soldiers then advance                 10515
16895: With sword and mace, together,
16896: Man after man, the foe will dance,
16897: And in their own blood quickly smother.
16898: 
16899: (He exits.)
16900: 
16901: The Commander-in-Chief
16902: 
16903: Let the central phalanx follow slowly,
16904: Engage the enemy with force and cunning:          10520
16905: There on the right they’re almost ready
16906: To surrender, you can see them running.
16907: Faust (Pointing to the central Warrior)
16908: 
16909: Let this man follow at your command!
16910: He’s quick, and grabs with either hand.
16911: 
16912: Grab-quick (Comes forward.)
16913: 
16914: The thirst for plunder now will greet              10525
16915: The Emperor’s troops’ advancing feet,
16916: And all will gather, with intent,
16917: At the rival Emperor’s tent.
16918: He won’t linger on his throne:
16919: I’ll lead the phalanx on my own.                   10530
16920: 
16921: Swift-plunder (A camp follower, fawning on him.)
16922: 
16923: Although he and I aren’t wed,
16924: He’s my sweetheart. Here instead
16925: Autumn ripens for the bold!
16926: Woman’s fierce when she takes hold,
16927: Merciless, in a plundering crowd,                  10535
16928: Forward to victory! All’s allowed.
16929: 
16930: (They exit together.)
16931: 
16932: The Commander-in-Chief
16933: 
16934: As I anticipated on our left flank,
16935: They hurl their right, in force, at last.
16936: We’ll resist their furious ranks,
16937: And keep them from the narrow pass.                10540
16938: 
16939: Faust (Beckoning to the Warrior on the left.)
16940: 
16941: Prince, take note of this man too:
16942: No shame if the strong are stronger than you.
16943: 
16944: Hold-tight (Coming forward.)
16945: 
16946: Let the flanks forget their fear!
16947: I seize the ground where I appear:
16948: In me are born the powers of old,                                    10545
16949: No lightning splits what I shall hold.
16950: 
16951: Mephistopheles (Descending from above.)
16952: 
16953: Now see how from the hinterland
16954: Of this rocky jagged land,
16955: An armed host bursts forth
16956: On narrow pathways from the north,                                   10550
16957: With sword and helmet, shield and spear,
16958: Forming a rampart in our rear:
16959: They wait for the signal to charge on.
16960: 
16961: (Aside, to the knowing ones.)
16962: 
16963: You mustn’t ask me where they’re from.
16964: I’ve gathered them from everywhere,                                  10555
16965: The armouries all around are bare:
16966: They stood on foot, and sat astride,
16967: Like lords of earth on every side:
16968: They were emperors, knights, and kings,
16969: Now they’re the empty shells of things:                              10560
16970: I’ve dressed so many spirits for the strife,
16971: It’s like the Middle Ages come to life.
16972: Whichever little devils are inside,
16973: They’ll have enough effect to turn the tide.
16974: 
16975: (Aloud.)
16976: 
16977: Listen how they show their anger,                                    10565
16978: Jostling, in metallic clangour!
16979: The ragged banners flutter free,
16980: That waited restless for the breeze.
16981: Think: here’s an ancient race that’s ready
16982: To mingle in our new dispute, and gladly.                            10570
16983: 
16984: (A tremendous peal of trumpets from above: a perceptible tremor in the
16985: hostile army.)
16986: Faust
16987: 
16988: The far horizon darkens swiftly,
16989: Yet, here and there, and meaningfully,
16990: There’s an incipient crimson glow,
16991: Already the battlefield gleams there,
16992: The rocks, the woods, the atmosphere,    10575
16993: The very heavens join the show.
16994: 
16995: Mephistopheles
16996: 
16997: The right flank holds in strength:
16998: There’s Bullyboy the nimble giant,
16999: Towering over all, defiant,
17000: And charging them at length.             10580
17001: 
17002: The Emperor
17003: 
17004: First I saw an arm uplifted,
17005: Then at least a dozen shifted:
17006: The thing’s unnatural.
17007: 
17008: Faust
17009: 
17010: Don’t you know the bands of mist
17011: That drift round the Sicilian cliffs?    10585
17012: There, in the daylight, clear,
17013: In mid-air, hovering about
17014: Mirrored in peculiar cloud,
17015: Marvellous images appear.
17016: Cities wander to and fro,                10590
17017: Gardens rise above, below,
17018: As form on form fills the air.
17019: 
17020: The Emperor
17021: 
17022: Yet it’s suspicious! All about
17023: The tips of spears are shining out:
17024: On our phalanx’ gleaming lances,         10595
17025: I see a crowd of flame-lets dances.
17026: It looks quite ghostly there, to me.
17027: 
17028: Faust
17029: 
17030: Forgive me, Lord, those are the traces
17031: Of natural spirits, vanished races,
17032: A glimmer of the Dioscuri,                           10600
17033: Sailors invoke in tempest’s fury:
17034: They show their last strength there.
17035: 
17036: The Emperor
17037: 
17038: But tell me: who then might command
17039: Nature’s assistance for our land,
17040: This gathering of the rare?                          10605
17041: 
17042: Mephistopheles
17043: 
17044: Who else than that noble Master,
17045: Who takes your destiny to heart?
17046: The thought of military disaster
17047: Moves him deeply, stirs his art.
17048: In gratitude, he wants to save you,                  10610
17049: Though he himself should suffer too.
17050: 
17051: The Emperor
17052: 
17053: They cheered me, when I was invested:
17054: So I was keen to see my power tested:
17055: I found it useful, without much thought, as ruler,
17056: To send that wise man where the air was cooler.      10615
17057: I robbed the clergy of a fond desire,
17058: And hardly won their favour from the fire.
17059: Now that so many years have gone
17060: Is this the reward of what I’d done?
17061: Faust
17062: 
17063: Good deeds from the heart reap riches:     10620
17064: Let your glance stray upwards now!
17065: I think he’ll send a sign, a show,
17066: Attend: straight away it’s as he wishes.
17067: 
17068: The Emperor
17069: 
17070: An eagle soars in the upper air,
17071: A Gryphon attacks him there.               10625
17072: 
17073: Faust
17074: 
17075: Attend: It’s an auspicious feature.
17076: The Gryphon’s a fabulous creature:
17077: How could he forget who’s regal,
17078: And tangle with a real eagle?
17079: 
17080: The Emperor
17081: 
17082: And now, they fly in wider gyres,          10630
17083: They wheel together: swiftly now
17084: Then dash against each other’s bow,
17085: So neck and chest are ripped entire.
17086: 
17087: Faust
17088: 
17089: Now note the miserable Gryphon,
17090: Ripped and rumpled, hurt quite badly,      10635
17091: Now, with his lion’s tail all torn,
17092: He falls, and vanishes in a tree.
17093: 
17094: The Emperor
17095: 
17096: As it’s prophesied, so let it be!
17097: This whole thing’s astounding me.
17098: Mephistopheles (Towards the right.)
17099: 
17100: Driven by blows, ten times repeated,      10640
17101: The enemy force has retreated,
17102: And in the uncertain fight
17103: Drifts away towards the right,
17104: So defusing all the force
17105: Of their army’s sinister course.          10645
17106: Our phalanx with its spears tightening
17107: Moves to the right, and like lightening
17108: Strikes them in the weakest place:
17109: Now like the storm-driven waves
17110: They roar, with opposing force,           10650
17111: Wildly on their dual course:
17112: Gloriously all sound dies away,
17113: And victory is ours, I’d say!
17114: 
17115: The Emperor (On the left, to Faust.)
17116: 
17117: See! Something looks suspicious,
17118: Our position’s inauspicious,              10655
17119: Not a stone’s hurled in the air,
17120: The cliffs below are taken there,
17121: Bare the narrows, to the pass.
17122: Now! The enemy en masse
17123: Are ever nearer to the sun,               10660
17124: Perhaps we’re already overrun:
17125: An end to this unholy strife!
17126: Your arts won’t save my life.
17127: 
17128: (Pause.)
17129: 
17130: Mephistopheles
17131: 
17132: See, my two ravens come winging,
17133: What news might they be bringing?         10665
17134: I fear we’re in trouble here.
17135: The Emperor
17136: 
17137: What do they mean these wretched birds?
17138: Their black wings turn hitherwards,
17139: Out of the heat of battle they steer.
17140: 
17141: Mephistopheles (To the ravens.)
17142: 
17143: Both of you sit by my ear,                10670
17144: None are lost if you are near,
17145: Your council’s always good to hear.
17146: 
17147: Faust (To the Emperor.)
17148: 
17149: You’ll know about homing pigeons
17150: Ones that return from distant regions,
17151: To their nest, and food, and young.       10675
17152: Here’s a slightly different kind:
17153: Pigeon post in peace is fine,
17154: Raven posts to war belong.
17155: 
17156: Mephistopheles
17157: 
17158: The birds announce a dreadful fate:
17159: Beware the enemy at the gate,             10680
17160: Near our heroes’ rocky wall!
17161: They’ve attained the narrow height,
17162: If they gain the pass, and fight,
17163: Our position’s critical.
17164: 
17165: The Emperor
17166: 
17167: So I’m betrayed at last!                  10685
17168: Into your net I’ll be cast:
17169: I shudder as it entangles me.
17170: Mephistopheles
17171: 
17172: Courage, now! Not yet, their victory.
17173: Patience and skill unties the knot!
17174: It’s often fiercest at the end.                         10690
17175: The pair of messengers, we’ve got:
17176: Command me, I’ll command them!
17177: 
17178: The Commander-In-Chief (Who has arrived, meanwhile.)
17179: 
17180: You’ve united with this pair,
17181: Tormenting me while I was there,
17182: No luck comes from wizardry.                            10695
17183: I can’t fathom now how to win
17184: Those should finish, that begin:
17185: Take this baton away from me.
17186: 
17187: The Emperor
17188: 
17189: Keep it for another day, one better
17190: And blessed with better fortune.                        10700
17191: I shudder at this messenger,
17192: And his company of ravens.
17193: 
17194: (To Mephistopheles.)
17195: 
17196: I’ll not grant the baton to you,
17197: You’re not the proper man:
17198: Give commands: free us too!                             10705
17199: Do whatever it is you can.
17200: 
17201: (He exits into his tent with the Commander-In-Chief.)
17202: 
17203: Mephistopheles
17204: 
17205: Let that blunt stick protect the man!
17206: It’s of small use in anyone’s hand:
17207: It has a cross, too, painted on.
17208: Faust
17209: 
17210: What can we do?
17211: 
17212: Mephistopheles
17213: 
17214:                           It’s already done!          10710
17215: Now dark Cousins, hurry from the scene,
17216: To the mountain lake! Greet the Undines,
17217: And beg from them their gleaming flood.
17218: Their female arts, those difficult of knowing,
17219: Can divorce appearances from being,                   10715
17220: And all still swear it’s being that they’re seeing.
17221: 
17222: (Pause)
17223: 
17224: Faust
17225: 
17226: With flattery our pair of ravens
17227: Have so charmed those water maidens
17228: That trickling flows at once begin.
17229: And many a bald, dry ridge of mountain                10720
17230: Becomes a swollen, rushing fountain:
17231: The enemy can no longer win.
17232: 
17233: Mephistopheles
17234: 
17235: It’s not a greeting to which they’re used.
17236: The bravest climbers appear confused.
17237: 
17238: Faust
17239: 
17240: Now, powerfully, streams pour on streams,             10725
17241: Sweeping from gorges with redoubled gleams,
17242: A river now throws up an arching veil:
17243: Pours over the rocky level in a tide,
17244: Runs foaming down, on every side,
17245: And, stepwise, hurls itself into the dale.            10730
17246: What use their fine, heroic resistance?
17247: The vast wave roars, and fills the distance.
17248: I shudder myself at this wild waterfall.
17249: 
17250: Mephistopheles
17251: 
17252: I can see nothing of these watery lies,
17253: They only serve for fooling human eyes,             10735
17254: I delight instead in wonders that befall.
17255: In companies, their men plunge down,
17256: The fools imagine that they’ll drown,
17257: While free to breathe, on solid ground,
17258: With swimming strokes, they run around.             10740
17259: It’s bewildering them all.
17260: 
17261: (The Ravens return.)
17262: 
17263: I’ll praise you to the noble Master: but see,
17264: If you’d like to display your own mastery,
17265: Hurry to the glowing smithy,
17266: Where the dwarf folk never weary,                   10745
17267: Hammering sparks from steel and stone.
17268: Ask for, once you’ve chattered first,
17269: A fire to shine: sparkle, and burst,
17270: The finest that man’s ever known.
17271: It’s true that far off lightning flashes,           10750
17272: And stars that fall in sudden dashes,
17273: Can happen any summer’s night:
17274: But lightning in the tangled bushes,
17275: And stars that fizzle in the rushes,
17276: They’re not such a common sight.                    10755
17277: Don’t trouble about my command,
17278: Ask first, then afterwards demand.
17279: 
17280: (The Ravens fly off. All takes place as ordered.)
17281: 
17282: Darkness cloaks the enemy!
17283: Their footsteps meet uncertainty!
17284: Everywhere are wandering flares,                    10760
17285: And those sudden blinding glares!
17286: It’s all beautiful indeed,
17287: Now some noise is what we need.
17288: Faust
17289: 
17290: The empty armour from each vaulted room,
17291: Feels itself stiffen in the airy gloom:                                 10765
17292: There it rattles, clatters all around,
17293: A marvellous, and deceptive sound.
17294: 
17295: Mephistopheles
17296: 
17297: That’s it! They no longer feel constrained:
17298: Already their blows fall unrestrained,
17299: As in the nobility of their former life.                                10770
17300: Breastplates and helmets gleam,
17301: As Guelph and Ghibelline,
17302: They quickly renew eternal strife.
17303: Locked in hereditary bile,
17304: They prove themselves, un-reconciled:                                   10775
17305: Far and wide the noise is rife.
17306: In the end, by all the Devils, yes!
17307: Partisan hatred’s still the best,
17308: Till final ruin ends the tale:
17309: Here rise the sounds of utter panic,                                    10780
17310: And others bitter and Satanic,
17311: Terrify, along the vale.
17312: 
17313: (Warlike tumult from the orchestra, finally changing to a lively martial air.)
17314: Part II Act IV Scene III: The Rival Emperor’s Tent
17315: 
17316: (A throne amongst rich trappings. Grab-quick and Swift-plunder.)
17317: 
17318: Swift-plunder
17319: 
17320: We’re the first ones here, I see!
17321: 
17322: Grab-quick
17323: 
17324: No Raven flies as fast as me.
17325: 
17326: Swift-plunder
17327: 
17328: O! Look at the treasure there on top!                              10785
17329: What will I grab? How shall I stop?
17330: 
17331: Grab-quick
17332: 
17333: The whole place is still full of loot,
17334: I don’t know where to start, in truth!
17335: 
17336: Swift-plunder
17337: 
17338: This fur-rug, this’ll go far,
17339: Often my bed’s far too hard.                                       10790
17340: 
17341: Grab-quick
17342: 
17343: Here’s a morning star in steel,
17344: I’ve always longed for one, I feel.
17345: 
17346: Swift-plunder
17347: 
17348: This red mantle, trimmed with gold,
17349: Is like the one my dream foretold.
17350: Grab-quick (Taking a weapon.)
17351: 
17352: With this the deed is swiftly done,     10795
17353: You strike him dead and then move on.
17354: You’ve already packed so much stuff,
17355: And yet you’ve nothing good enough.
17356: Leave your plunder in its place,
17357: And put a casket in the space!          10800
17358: The army’s pay is what they hold,
17359: In their fat bellies, purest gold.
17360: 
17361: Swift-plunder
17362: 
17363: What a murderous weight it is!
17364: I can’t lift: I can’t carry it.
17365: 
17366: Grab-quick
17367: 
17368: Bend down: quick! You’ll have to bow!   10805
17369: I’ll strap it to your back for now.
17370: 
17371: Swift-plunder
17372: 
17373: Oh! Ah! Now it’s in front, too!
17374: The weight’s broken my cross in two.
17375: 
17376: (The chest falls and bursts open.)
17377: 
17378: Grab-quick
17379: 
17380: There’s the red gold in a heap –
17381: Quickly now, take and keep!             10810
17382: 
17383: Swift-plunder (Crouching.)
17384: 
17385: Quickly then, just fill my lap!
17386: There’ll still be enough perhaps.
17387: Grab-quick
17388: 
17389: That’s enough! Now off you go!
17390: 
17391: (Swift-plunder rises.)
17392: 
17393: Oh! Your apron has a hole!
17394: Wherever you walk or stand,                 10815
17395: You’re sowing gold on every hand.
17396: 
17397: Guardsmen of the True Emperor
17398: 
17399: What are you doing here, at leisure,
17400: Rummaging in the Imperial treasure?
17401: 
17402: Grab-quick
17403: 
17404: We risked our bodies in the ranks,
17405: And take away our share of thanks.          10820
17406: That’s the rule, in enemy tents,
17407: And we’re soldiers too, my friends.
17408: 
17409: The Guardsmen
17410: 
17411: That won’t wash in our army:
17412: You can’t be soldier and thief equally:
17413: Whoever serves our Emperor,                 10825
17414: Is an honest soldier, and no more.
17415: 
17416: Grab-quick
17417: 
17418: That honesty, we know it, son,
17419: It’s called: a contribution.
17420: You’re all the same: it’s a crime,
17421: ‘Give!’ is the password every time,         10830
17422: 
17423: (To Swift-plunder.)
17424: 
17425: Take what you’ve got: and leave the rest,
17426: Here one’s hardly a welcome guest.
17427: (They both exit.)
17428: 
17429: A Guardsman
17430: 
17431: Tell me why you didn’t land
17432: That churl with a good right hand.
17433: 
17434: A Second Guardsman
17435: 
17436: I don’t know, my strength was gone,                              10835
17437: They were a pair of ghostly ones.
17438: 
17439: A Third Guardsman
17440: 
17441: There was something nasty in my eye,
17442: I couldn’t see: they flickered by.
17443: 
17444: A Fourth Guardsman
17445: 
17446: I don’t know what to say:
17447: It was sweltering hot today,                                     10840
17448: So sultry, so close as well,
17449: One man stood, another fell:
17450: You staggered around and struck, in one,
17451: At every blow you killed someone,
17452: There was a mist in front of your eyes,                          10845
17453: Then a buzz, and rustle, and hiss went by:
17454: So it went on, and here we are, now,
17455: I don’t know what happened, anyhow.
17456: 
17457: (The Emperor enters, accompanied by Four Princes. The Guardsmen exit.)
17458: 
17459: Now, let him do as he may! The battle here is done,
17460: The host is scattered in flight, across the field new won.       10850
17461: Here is the traitor’s treasure, and his empty throne,
17462: Where tapestries hang round, closed in a narrow zone.
17463: Protected by our guard of honour, we’ll wait
17464: Imperially, for the people’s delegate.
17465: Messengers of joy arrive from every side:                        10855
17466: The Empire’s calm, and we’re mutually reconciled.
17467: Though some wizardry was involved in our fight,
17468: In the end we fought with only our own true might.
17469: There were of course a few lucky accidents:
17470: Stones from the sky, a shower of blood on their tents,    10860
17471: Strange and mighty sounds from the rocky caves,
17472: That lifted our hearts, and terrified their braves.
17473: The conquered fell, beneath our relentless scorn,
17474: Praising the kind god, our ranks cheer once more.
17475: And all, without coercion, shout together as one:         10865
17476: ‘God be praised!’ from a million throats is wrung.
17477: Yet in highest praise I turn my own pious glance
17478: As I seldom do, towards my own circumstance.
17479: A young man may well squander his early days,
17480: But age teaches him all the error of his ways.            10870
17481: Therefore at once without delay I bind you to me,
17482: You noble four, to my House, Court and country.
17483: 
17484: (To the First.)
17485: 
17486: Prince, yours was the army’s ordering, wisely planned,
17487: Then, at the height of the battle, its bold command:
17488: Now act, in time of peace, as the hour requires you to,   10875
17489: I name you High-Marshall, and confer the sword on you.
17490: 
17491: The High-Marshall
17492: 
17493: Your loyal army, deployed, on my orders,
17494: Internally, will now defend your borders,
17495: Let us, too, prepare the table on feast days,
17496: In your spacious castle’s ancestral ways.                 10880
17497: Always to be your High Majesty’s defence,
17498: Standing beside you, or marching in advance.
17499: 
17500: The Emperor (To the Second.)
17501: 
17502: You, who show yourself as gracious as you’re brave,
17503: Be our High-Chamberlain: the office is grave.
17504: You become the overseer of all our attendants,            10885
17505: Great evil comes from strife among dependants:
17506: So let your example honourably recall
17507: How they may please their prince, the court and all.
17508: 
17509: The High-Chamberlain
17510: 
17511: Be gracious, that the Lords may further your great aim:
17512: Assist the best and cause no injury to the lame,          10890
17513: Be open without cunning: be calm without deceit!
17514: If you know me, Sire, my ambition is complete.
17515: But on the feast may I now deploy my imagination?
17516: When you’re at table, I shall bear the golden basin,
17517: I’ll hold your rings, that on those joyful days           10895
17518: Your hands may be refreshed, as I am by your gaze.
17519: 
17520: The Emperor
17521: 
17522: I feel too serious for ready celebration,
17523: But, be it so, as a joyful inauguration!
17524: 
17525: (To the Third.)
17526: 
17527: I make you High-Steward! Oversee the chase,
17528: The poultry yard, and such, around the place:             10900
17529: Give me the finest dishes, choice and rare,
17530: In their right month, and carefully prepared.
17531: 
17532: The High-Steward
17533: 
17534: Strict fast will be my pleasant punishment,
17535: Till I can serve the tastiest refreshment.
17536: Your kitchen staff will join with me to bring             10905
17537: The distant near, and make the year take wing.
17538: Yet early and rare won’t stimulate your fires,
17539: Simple and strong, is what your taste desires.
17540: 
17541: The Emperor (To the Fourth.)
17542: 
17543: Since planning feasts is unavoidable here,
17544: Young hero, I’ll give you my cup to bear.                 10910
17545: High-Cupbearer, take care those cellars of mine
17546: Are richly filled with casks of vintage wine.
17547: Be temperate yourself: don’t lose your reason
17548: In the wild delight of momentary temptation!
17549: 
17550: The High-Cupbearer
17551: 
17552: The young, if you trust in them, my Prince,             10915
17553: Grow to manhood, almost before you’d notice.
17554: I’ll take my place too at your noble feast:
17555: And load the imperial table with all that’s best,
17556: With every kind of vessel, in silver and gold,
17557: But the handsomest of all for you I’ll hold:            10920
17558: A clear Venetian glass, where joy is waiting,
17559: That strengthens the taste, without intoxicating.
17560: One often trusts too much in such a treasure:
17561: But your restraint, Lord, will protect your pleasure.
17562: 
17563: The Emperor
17564: 
17565: What I bestow on you at this grave moment,              10925
17566: You hear, in confidence, has my true intent.
17567: The Emperor’s word is great, his gift is sure,
17568: But to be enacted it needs his signature,
17569: His noble mark. Here’s the right man I see
17570: True to his time, to complete the formality.            10930
17571: 
17572: (The Archbishop and High-Chancellor enters.)
17573: 
17574: If the arch can trust the keystone’s part,
17575: Then it’s raised securely, with lasting art.
17576: You see four Princes here! And I’ve explained
17577: How my House and Court must be sustained.
17578: Now, what the empire holds within its bounds            10935
17579: Is placed, with weight and power, in your hands.
17580: You’ll outshine all others in your estates:
17581: So I’ve extended your walls and gates,
17582: With the lost possessions of our enemy.
17583: I award you fine lands, for your loyalty.               10940
17584: Together with the right, in due course,
17585: To buy, exchange, or add to them by force:
17586: Then, be it known, I grant you unhindered use –
17587: Of what belongs to you, the landlord’s dues.
17588: When you as judges speak your final thought,              10945
17589: No appeal shall be heard by a higher court.
17590: Then taxes, levies, rents, and tolls and fees,
17591: Are yours: of mines, mints, salt the royalties.
17592: And to display my gratitude completely,
17593: I’ve raised you all to highest majesty.                   10950
17594: 
17595: The Archbishop
17596: 
17597: On behalf of us all I give our deepest thanks to you!
17598: You make us strong and sure: increasing your power too.
17599: 
17600: The Emperor
17601: 
17602: To you five, still higher favours will I give.
17603: I live for my empire, and I still wish to live:
17604: Yet ancient, noble ties draw the careful thinker          10955
17605: From present things to those that follow after.
17606: I too, in time, must leave all I still hold dear,
17607: It’s your duty then to name a new ruler, here.
17608: At our holy altar, crown and raise him high:
17609: What war begins ends peacefully, by and by.               10960
17610: 
17611: The High-Chancellor
17612: 
17613: With pride at heart, yet humble in gesture, too,
17614: We, the Earth’s noblest princes bow to you.
17615: So long as blood fills our loyal veins, then still
17616: Are we the body that obeys your every will.
17617: 
17618: The Emperor
17619: 
17620: Now, to conclude, let everything we’ve enacted            10965
17621: Be set down for the future, as we’ve contracted.
17622: As Lords you hold your possessions, free in fact,
17623: With this condition, that they remain intact.
17624: And what you have from us, whatever else is won,
17625: Shall descend in due measure to the eldest son.           10970
17626: The High-Chancellor
17627: 
17628: I’ll entrust it to parchment straight away,
17629: This weightiest statute to bless us, and the state:
17630: The Chancery will provide fair copy, and reveal
17631: You as confirmed, my Lords, by sign and seal.
17632: 
17633: The Emperor
17634: 
17635: And so I dismiss you that you may deliberate           10975
17636: Together, concerning this great day for our state.
17637: 
17638: (The Secular Princes exit.)
17639: 
17640: The Archbishop
17641: 
17642: The Chancellor leaves, the Bishop remains here,
17643: With this grave warning to offer in your ear.
17644: His paternal heart, anxiously, fears for you.
17645: 
17646: The Emperor
17647: 
17648: Speak, in this happy hour, what care’s on view?        10980
17649: 
17650: The Archbishop
17651: 
17652: With what bitter pain I find that even at this hour,
17653: Your hallowed head still toys with Satan’s power!
17654: True, you’ve secured the throne now, yet it seems,
17655: Sadly, scorning God, and the Pope’s great schemes.
17656: When he learns of it, swift punishment he’ll bring,    10985
17657: And destroy your sinful realm with holy lightning.
17658: He’s not forgotten how, at that earlier time,
17659: Of coronation, you freed the wizard: in crime.
17660: With your diadem, you injured Christianity,
17661: Striking a cursed head with the first act of mercy.    10990
17662: Now beat your breast and from your guilty measure,
17663: Give back to the holy shrine a little treasure:
17664: You, taught humility, devote to pious use, and good,
17665: The spacious stretch of hills where your tent stood.
17666: Where evil spirits gathered for your protection,         10995
17667: And the Prince of Liars secured your attention:
17668: Grant mount and forest deep, as far as they extend,
17669: And heights, the green slopes adorn, without end.
17670: Clear lakes rich in fish, countless streams that flow,
17671: Winding swiftly, that rush to the valleys below:         11000
17672: Then the broad vale itself, meadow, lawn and hollow:
17673: Show your remorse: gain the mercy that must follow.
17674: 
17675: The Emperor
17676: 
17677: I’m deeply fearful of this, my heavy sin:
17678: Yourself, mark out the borders of the scheme.
17679: 
17680: The Archbishop
17681: 
17682: First then the place profaned by such sinfulness,        11005
17683: Dedicate that to the service of heavenliness.
17684: Thick walls rise quickly, at the mind’s desire,
17685: Already the sun’s dawn glance lights the choir,
17686: The growing building takes the cross’s structure,
17687: The nave long and high, a delight to each believer:      11010
17688: Already as they press eagerly through the doors,
17689: A first peal rings through hills, down valley floors,
17690: From the high tower, that’s striving towards heaven,
17691: The penitent comes, to whom new life is given.
17692: That day of consecration – may it be soon! –             11015
17693: When your presence grants the greatest boon.
17694: 
17695: The Emperor
17696: 
17697: Let the pious mind proclaim so great an action,
17698: In praising the Lord, I’ll achieve my expiation.
17699: Enough! I already feel my mind’s exaltation.
17700: 
17701: The Archbishop
17702: 
17703: As Chancellor I require a formal proclamation.           11020
17704: The Emperor
17705: 
17706: A formal document: lay that before me,
17707: I’ll be pleased to sign whatever the Church agrees.
17708: 
17709: The Archbishop (Has taken leave, but turns back at the door.)
17710: 
17711: At the same time devote the total income of the land,
17712: As it arises, tithes, taxes, levies, to the work on hand,
17713: Forever. It needs to be maintained, fairly,                     11025
17714: And its careful upkeep will cost us dearly.
17715: From all that plunder, grant us a measure of gold,
17716: To build it quickly there, in that desert fold.
17717: Moreover we’ll need, I can’t help mentioning,
17718: Timber from far off, lime, slate, and such things.              11030
17719: Exhorted from the pulpit, the folk will haul it,
17720: The Church will bless the man who learns to serve it.
17721: 
17722: (He exits.)
17723: 
17724: The Emperor
17725: 
17726: The sin with which my soul is heavy, is full sore:
17727: Wretched Sorcerers have wounded me, once more.
17728: 
17729: The Archbishop (Returning, yet again, and bowing deeply.)
17730: 
17731: Pardon, my Lord! The Imperial shore was given                   11035
17732: To that disreputable man, I’ll excommunicate him,
17733: Unless you in penitence grant the Church, there, too,
17734: Its tithes, and gifts, and taxes: the whole of its revenue.
17735: 
17736: The Emperor (In a bad humour.)
17737: 
17738: That land doesn’t exist, it lies there under the sea.
17739: 
17740: The Archbishop
17741: 
17742: Who’s patient, and is right, his time is yet to be.             11040
17743: For us, your word must wait on one man’s desire.
17744: (He exits.)
17745: 
17746: The Emperor (Alone.)
17747: 
17748: I might as well sign away the whole wide empire.
17749: Part II Act V Scene I: Open Country
17750: 
17751: The Wanderer
17752: 
17753: Yes! Here are the dusky lindens,
17754: Standing round, in mighty age.
17755: And here am I, returning to them,       11045
17756: After so long a pilgrimage!
17757: It still appears the same old place:
17758: Here’s the hut that sheltered me,
17759: When the storm-uplifted wave,
17760: Hurled me shore-wards from the sea!     11050
17761: My hosts are those I would bless,
17762: A brave, a hospitable pair,
17763: Who if I meet them, I confess,
17764: Must already be white haired.
17765: Ah! They were pious people!             11055
17766: Shall I call, or knock? – Greetings,
17767: If, as open-hearted, you still
17768: Enjoy good luck, in meetings!
17769: 
17770: Baucis (A little woman, very aged.)
17771: 
17772: Gentle stranger! Quietly, quietly!
17773: Peace! Let my husband rest!             11060
17774: Long sleep lends the elderly,
17775: Little time to work, at best.
17776: 
17777: The Wanderer
17778: 
17779: Tell me, Mother: are you that wife
17780: To whom thanks should be given:
17781: Who brought a young man back to life,   11065
17782: When wife and husband worked as one?
17783: Are you that Baucis who tirelessly
17784: Restored my almost-vanished breath?
17785: 
17786: (Her husband appears.)
17787: 
17788: Are you that Philemon, who bravely
17789: Saved my wealth from watery death?              11070
17790: Your swiftly burning fire,
17791: Your silvery sounding bell,
17792: In chance, dread and dire,
17793: Was the outcome that befell.
17794: And now let me walk about,                      11075
17795: And view the boundless ocean:
17796: Let me kneel, and be devout:
17797: Mind troubled with emotion.
17798: 
17799: (He walks on, over the downs.)
17800: 
17801: Philemon (To Baucis.)
17802: 
17803: Hurry now, and lay the table,
17804: Underneath the garden trees.                    11080
17805: Let him go: as in the fable,
17806: He’ll not credit what he sees.
17807: 
17808: (He follows, and stands beside the Wanderer.)
17809: 
17810: Where wave on wave, foaming wildly,
17811: Savagely mistreated you,
17812: See a garden planted, widely,                   11085
17813: See the Paradisial view.
17814: I was too old to seize the day,
17815: Unfit to work as long ago:
17816: And while my powers ebbed away,
17817: The tide extended its wide flow.                11090
17818: Clever Lords set their bold servants
17819: Digging ditches, building dikes,
17820: To gain the mastery of ocean,
17821: Diminishing its natural rights.
17822: See green meadow bordering meadow,              11095
17823: Field and garden, wood and town. –
17824: But it’s time to eat, so follow,
17825: Sunset is approaching now.
17826: See the sails, far away there,
17827: Seeking port before the night.                  11100
17828: The birds fly homeward through the air:
17829: Their harbour too heaves in sight.
17830: So gaze then, at the whole horizon,
17831: Where the blue sea used to flow,
17832: Right and left there, to your vision,   11105
17833: Densely peopled space below.
17834: Part II Act V Scene II: In the Little Garden
17835: 
17836: (The three of them at table.)
17837: 
17838: Baucis (To the stranger.)
17839: 
17840: Are you dumb? And will you lift
17841: Not a morsel to your mouth?
17842: 
17843: Philemon
17844: 
17845: He wants to comprehend the gift:
17846: Tell him, freely then: speak out.              11110
17847: 
17848: Baucis
17849: 
17850: Well! It was a marvel, really!
17851: It troubles me to this day:
17852: Then its whole nature, surely,
17853: Was peculiar, in its way.
17854: 
17855: Philemon
17856: 
17857: Is the Emperor, then, at fault,                11115
17858: Who granted him the land?
17859: Didn’t a herald make his halt,
17860: Crying out what was planned?
17861: Not far away there, on the dunes,
17862: The first bold step was made,                  11120
17863: Tents, huts! – And on the downs,
17864: A palace, quickly raised.
17865: 
17866: Baucis
17867: 
17868: For days, work rumbled on in vain,
17869: Pick and shovel, blow on blow:
17870: Where the night’s fires flamed,                11125
17871: Next day a dam would follow.
17872: Human blood was forced to flow,
17873: At night, rose the sound of pain:
17874: The seaward floating fiery glow
17875: Was a canal, come dawn again.         11130
17876: He’s a godless man: he’d steal
17877: Our hut, and our few acres:
17878: But like subjects we must kneel,
17879: When we boast such neighbours.
17880: 
17881: Philemon
17882: 
17883: Yet he’s offered us another           11135
17884: Holding, on his new-won land!
17885: 
17886: Baucis
17887: 
17888: Never trust what’s built on water,
17889: On the heights maintain your stand.
17890: 
17891: Philemon
17892: 
17893: Let’s make our way to the chapel,
17894: To watch the last glow of light,      11140
17895: Kneel, pray, and sound the bell,
17896: And trust in God’s ancient might!
17897: Part II Act V Scene III: The Palace
17898: 
17899: (Spacious pleasure-gardens: a broad straight canal. Faust in extreme old
17900: age, walking about, thoughtfully.)
17901: 
17902: Lynceus, the Warder (Through a speaking trumpet.)
17903: 
17904: The sun is fading, the last boats
17905: Sail swiftly to the harbour here.
17906: One large vessel gently floats,                                      11145
17907: Down the canal: and draws near.
17908: The bright flags flutter merrily,
17909: The masts are trimmed, in time:
17910: The boatmen all praise you gladly,
17911: Fortune celebrates your prime.                                       11150
17912: 
17913: (The little bell on the dunes rings out.)
17914: 
17915: Faust (Startled.)
17916: 
17917: Accursed ringing! Wounding me
17918: With shame: a treacherous blow:
17919: My realm’s laid out there, endlessly,
17920: But, at my back, this vexes so,
17921: Proclaiming, with its jealous sound:                                 11155
17922: My great estate is less than fine,
17923: The old hut, all the trees around,
17924: The crumbling chapel, are not mine.
17925: And even if I wished to rest there,
17926: A strange shadow makes me shudder,                                   11160
17927: It’s a thorn in my eye, and deeper:
17928: Oh! Would I were somewhere other!
17929: 
17930: The Warder (From above.)
17931: 
17932: The boat is sailing, brightly dressed,
17933: Towards us, on the evening breeze!
17934: Heaped, with boxes, sacks and chests,                                11165
17935: From its journey on the seas!
17936: (A splendid boat, richly and brightly loaded with foreign goods.)
17937: 
17938: (Mephistopheles. The Three Mighty Warriors.)
17939: 
17940: Chorus
17941: 
17942: Here we land,
17943: Already, here.
17944: Hail to our Lord,
17945: Our patron dear!                                                    11170
17946: 
17947: (They disembark: the goods are unloaded.)
17948: 
17949: Mephistopheles
17950: 
17951: We’ve proven ourselves in every way,
17952: Pleased, if we win our patron’s praise.
17953: We took two ships when we sailed before
17954: With twenty ships we dock, once more.
17955: What we’ve achieved, each fine thing,                               11175
17956: You’ll see from the cargo that we bring.
17957: The ocean’s freedom frees the mind
17958: There all thought is left behind!
17959: You only need a handy grip,
17960: You catch a fish, or take a ship,                                   11180
17961: And once you’re lord of all three,
17962: The fourth one’s tackled easily:
17963: The fifth one’s in an evil plight,
17964: You have the might, and so the right.
17965: You wonder what, and never how.                                     11185
17966: I know a little of navigation:
17967: War, trade, and piracy, allow,
17968: As three in one, no separation.
17969: The Three Mighty Warriors
17970: 
17971: No thanks for us!
17972: No thanks at all!               11190
17973: As if we’ve brought
17974: A stench, that’s all.
17975: He pulls a
17976: Nasty face again:
17977: These royal goods               11195
17978: Don’t please him then.
17979: 
17980: Mephistopheles
17981: 
17982: Don’t expect more
17983: Pay for it!
17984: What you’ve had
17985: Is what you get.                11200
17986: 
17987: The Warriors
17988: 
17989: That was only
17990: To pass the time:
17991: We want an equal
17992: Share in crime.
17993: 
17994: Mephistopheles
17995: 
17996: Then first set out in           11205
17997: Hall on hall,
17998: The costly treasures,
17999: One and all!
18000: And coming to
18001: The splendid show,              11210
18002: He’ll think it all the
18003: More, you know,
18004: He won’t be mean,
18005: With you, at least,
18006: He’ll give the fleet,           11215
18007: Feast on feast.
18008: Tomorrow motley birds attend,
18009: I want to take good care of them.
18010: 
18011: (The cargo is removed.)
18012: 
18013: (To Faust.)
18014: 
18015: This splendid fortune you embrace
18016: With wrinkled brow, and gloomy face!         11220
18017: Your noble wisdom has been crowned,
18018: Sea’s reconciled with solid ground:
18019: From the shore, on swifter track,
18020: The sea wills out the ship, and back:
18021: So speak, that here, from your spire,        11225
18022: Your arms might grip the world entire.
18023: From this place the trench was cut,
18024: Here stood the first wooden hut:
18025: A little ditch was traced from here,
18026: Where now vessels’ wakes appear.             11230
18027: Your servants’ toil, your thought so wise,
18028: Have won the Earth and Ocean’s prize.
18029: From here on –
18030: 
18031: Faust
18032:                  – that accursed here!
18033: That always brings me wretched fear,
18034: To you who are so clever, I say it,          11235
18035: It gives my heart sting on sting,
18036: It’s impossible for me to bear it.
18037: I’m ashamed to even speak the thing.
18038: The old ones up there should yield,
18039: I want the limes as my retreat,              11240
18040: The least tree in another’s field,
18041: Detracts from my whole estate.
18042: There, to stand and look around,
18043: I’ll build a frame from bough to bough,
18044: My gaze revealing, under the sun,            11245
18045: A view of everything I’ve done,
18046: Overseeing, as the eye falls on it,
18047: A masterpiece of the human spirit,
18048: Forging with intelligence,
18049: A wider human residence.                          11250
18050: That’s the worst suffering can bring,
18051: Being rich, to feel we lack something.
18052: The bell’s chime, the lindens’ breeze,
18053: Like tombs in churchyards stifle me.
18054: The exercise of my all-conquering will            11255
18055: Is shattered in the sand, here, and lies still.
18056: How can I drive it from my nature!
18057: The bell peals, and I’m an angry creature.
18058: 
18059: Mephistopheles
18060: 
18061: It’s natural! Intense frustration
18062: Drives a man to desperation.                      11260
18063: Who doubts it! That clang I fear
18064: Falls cruelly on a noble ear.
18065: And that wretched bing-bang-bong,
18066: Through the clear evening sky, that gong,
18067: Is joined to every chance event,                  11265
18068: From first bath to last interment.
18069: As if between its bing and bong
18070: Life’s a dream, and then is gone.
18071: 
18072: Faust
18073: 
18074: Such obstinacy and opposition
18075: Diminishes the noblest position,                  11270
18076: Until in endless pain, one must
18077: Grow deeply weary of being just.
18078: 
18079: Mephistopheles
18080: 
18081: Why bother yourself so much about them?
18082: Shouldn’t you long ago have colonised them?
18083: Faust
18084: 
18085: Then go and push them aside for me! –           11275
18086: You know the land, with my approval,
18087: Set aside for the old folks removal.
18088: 
18089: Mephistopheles
18090: 
18091: We’ll take them up, and set them down,
18092: They’ll stand, once more: I’ll be bound:
18093: When they’ve survived a little force,           11280
18094: They’ll be reconciled to it, of course.
18095: 
18096: (He whistles shrilly.)
18097: 
18098: Come: perform your Lord’s command!
18099: And tomorrow let the feast be planned.
18100: 
18101: The Three Warriors
18102: 
18103: This old Lord received us badly,
18104: A feast now is our right: believe me.           11285
18105: 
18106: Mephistopheles (To the audience.)
18107: 
18108: And here we see, as long ago
18109: Naboth’s vineyard still on show. (Kings I:21)
18110: Part II Act V Scene IV: Dead of Night
18111: 
18112: Lynceus, the Warder (Singing on the watch-tower of the palace.)
18113: 
18114: For seeing, I’m born,
18115: For watching, employed,
18116: To the tower, I’m sworn,                                          11290
18117: While the world, I enjoy.
18118: I gaze at the far,
18119: I stare at the near,
18120: The moon and the star,
18121: The forest and deer:                                              11295
18122: The eternally lovely
18123: Adornment, I view,
18124: And as it delights me
18125: I delight myself too.
18126: You, fortunate eyes,                                              11300
18127: All you’ve seen, there,
18128: Let it be as it may,
18129: Yet it was so fair!
18130: 
18131: (Pause.)
18132: 
18133: I’m not positioned here, on high,
18134: Just for my own enjoyment:                                        11305
18135: What horror, meant to terrify,
18136: Threatens from the firmament!
18137: I see sparks of fire gushing
18138: Through the lindens’ double night,
18139: Fanned by the wind’s rushing,                                     11310
18140: Ever stronger grows the light.
18141: Ah! Within, the hut is burning,
18142: Damp and mossy though it stand:
18143: Swift help, in this direction turning,
18144: Is needed, yet no aid’s to hand.                                  11315
18145: Ah! The pious old couple,
18146: So careful ever of the fire,
18147: Made a prey to smoke, to stifle,
18148: On this dreadful pyre!
18149: The flame burns on: glowing red,
18150: It’s now a blackened mossy pile:                 11320
18151: If only those good folk are rescued,
18152: From those fires of hell, run wild!
18153: A bright tongue of lightning heaves,
18154: Through the branches, through the leaves:        11325
18155: Breaking, snapping, catching swiftly,
18156: Withered branches flicker, glow.
18157: Why have I such powers to see!
18158: Why are mine the eyes that know!
18159: The little chapel now collapses,                 11330
18160: With the falling branches’ weight.
18161: Already with bright snakelike flashes,
18162: The treetops, gripped, meet their fate.
18163: Glowing crimson, to their hollow
18164: Roots, the trunks now burn with ease. –          11335
18165: 
18166: (A long pause. Chant.)
18167: 
18168: What used to please my eyes, below,
18169: Has vanished with the centuries.
18170: 
18171: Faust (On the balcony, towards the downs.)
18172: 
18173: What whining song is that, above?
18174: Too late its word and tone reach me.
18175: The watchman wails: yes, I’m moved:              11340
18176: Annoyed by this impatient deed.
18177: But let the lime-trees be erased,
18178: A horror now of half-burnt timber,
18179: A watchtower can soon be raised,
18180: To gaze around at boundless splendour.           11345
18181: From there I’ll see my new creation,
18182: One set aside for that old pair: at least,
18183: They’ll feel benign consideration,
18184: Enjoying their last days in peace.
18185: 
18186: Mephistopheles and the Three Warriors (Below.)
18187: 
18188: Here we come, and at the double:                 11350
18189: Pardon us! We’ve caused you trouble.
18190: We knocked, and knocked on the door,
18191: But it seemed locked for evermore:
18192: We rattled it, and shook it too,
18193: Until the planks broke in two:                  11355
18194: We called aloud, and threatened, then,
18195: But there was no reply, again.
18196: And as happens in such cases,
18197: They heard nothing, hid their faces:
18198: But we commenced without delay                  11360
18199: To drive the stubborn folk away.
18200: That pair knew scant anxiety,
18201: They died of terror, peacefully.
18202: A stranger, who was hiding there,
18203: And wished to fight, we tried to scare.         11365
18204: But in the fast and furious bout,
18205: From the coals that lay about,
18206: The straw took fire. Now all three,
18207: In that one pyre, burn merrily.
18208: 
18209: Faust
18210: 
18211: Were you deaf to what I said?                   11370
18212: I wanted them moved, not dead.
18213: This mindless, and savage blow,
18214: Earns my curse: share it, and go!
18215: 
18216: Chorus
18217: 
18218: The ancient proverb says of course:
18219: Yield willingly to a greater force!             11375
18220: While if you’re bold and opt for strife,
18221: You’ll stake your house, and home – and life.
18222: 
18223: (They exit.)
18224: 
18225: Faust (On the balcony.)
18226: 
18227: Stars hide their faces, and their glow,
18228: The fire sinks, and flickers low:
18229: A moist breeze fans the dying ember,            11380
18230: Bringing smoke and vapour closer.
18231: Quickly said, too quickly done, I fear! –
18232: Now, what hovers like a shadow, here?
18233: Part II Act V Scene V: Midnight
18234: 
18235: (Four Grey Women enter.)
18236: 
18237: The First
18238: 
18239: I am called Want.
18240: 
18241: The Second
18242: 
18243:                     I am called Guilt.
18244: 
18245: The Third
18246: 
18247: I am called Care.
18248: 
18249: The Fourth
18250: 
18251:                     Necessity, I.                  11385
18252: 
18253: 
18254: Three Together (Want, Guilt and Necessity)
18255: 
18256: The door is shut tight, and we cannot get in:
18257: The owner is rich: he won’t have us within.
18258: 
18259: Want
18260: 
18261: I shrink to a shadow.
18262: 
18263: Guilt
18264: 
18265:                               To emptiest space.
18266: 
18267: Need
18268: 
18269: The wealthy from me turn their pampered face.
18270: Care
18271: 
18272: Sisters, you can’t enter, daren’t enter there.         11390
18273: But, through the keyhole now, always slips, Care.
18274: 
18275: (Care disappears.)
18276: 
18277: Want
18278: 
18279: You, my Grey Sisters, take your flight too.
18280: 
18281: Guilt
18282: 
18283: Close by your side, I come following you.
18284: 
18285: Necessity
18286: 
18287: Close at your heels is Necessity’s breath.
18288: 
18289: The Three
18290: 
18291: The clouds there are moving, and cover the stars!      11395
18292: Behind us, behind us! From far, oh, from far,
18293: He’s coming, our Brother, he’s coming, he’s – Death.
18294: 
18295: Faust (In the Palace.)
18296: 
18297: I saw four: but only three went away:
18298: I caught no meaning from the words they say.
18299: It sounded as if I heard – ‘Necessity’s breath’,       11400
18300: And then a gloomy rhyming word, like – ‘Death’.
18301: It rang hollow, ghostly, subdued, to me.
18302: Even now I’ve not won my liberty.
18303: If I could banish Sorcery from my track,
18304: Unlearn the magic-spells that draw me back,            11405
18305: And stand before you, Nature, as mere Man,
18306: It would be worth the pain of being Human.
18307: So was I, a seeker in the darkness,
18308: Cursing both self and world, in wickedness.
18309: Now the air is filled with phantom shapes,             11410
18310: It’s hard to see how anyone escapes.
18311: Though day may smile on us with rational gleams,
18312: The night entwines us in a web of dreams:
18313: We come happily from the fields of youth,
18314: A bird croaks: what? Misfortune: is our truth.              11415
18315: Cloaked with superstitions, soon and late:
18316: It’s wedded to us, warns us: shows our fate.
18317: And so, alone, intimidated, we stand.
18318: The door creaks, yet no one is at hand.
18319: 
18320: (Anxiously.)
18321: 
18322: Is anyone there?
18323: 
18324: Care
18325:                     The answer must be, yes!                11420
18326: 
18327: Faust
18328: 
18329: And you, who then are you?
18330: 
18331: Care
18332: 
18333:                              I am your guest.
18334: 
18335: Faust
18336: 
18337: Be gone!
18338: 
18339: Care
18340: 
18341:                I am here, in my proper place.
18342: 
18343: Faust (First angered, then composed, addressing himself.)
18344: 
18345: Take care: of magic spells show not a trace.
18346: Care
18347: 
18348: Though the ear choose not to hear,
18349: In the heart I echo, clear:                  11425
18350: Savage power I exercise,
18351: Transformed I am, to mortal eyes.
18352: On the land, and on the ocean,
18353: Evermore the dread companion,
18354: Always found, and never sought,              11430
18355: Praised, as well as cursed, in thought. –
18356: Have you yourself not known Care?
18357: 
18358: Faust
18359: 
18360: I sped through the World that’s there:
18361: Gripped by the hair every appetite,
18362: And let go those that failed to delight,     11435
18363: Let those fly that quite escaped me.
18364: I’ve desired, achieved my course,
18365: Desired again, and so, with force,
18366: Stormed through life: first powerfully,
18367: But wisely now: and thoughtfully.            11440
18368: Earth’s sphere’s familiar enough to me,
18369: The view beyond is barred eternally:
18370: The fool who sets his sights up there,
18371: Creates his own likeness in the air!
18372: Let him stand, and look around him well:     11445
18373: This world means something to the capable.
18374: Why does he need to roam eternity!
18375: Let him grasp what is firm reality.
18376: So let him wander down his earthly day:
18377: And if ghosts haunt him, go on his way,      11450
18378: Find joy and suffering in striding on,
18379: Dissatisfied with every hour that’s gone.
18380: Care
18381: 
18382: When of man I take possession,
18383: Then his whole world is lessened:
18384: Endless gloom meets his eyes,        11455
18385: No more suns will set or rise,
18386: Though intact, to outer sense,
18387: He lives in the dark, intense,
18388: Never knowing how to measure
18389: Any portion of his treasure.         11460
18390: Good and ill are merely chance,
18391: He starves, food in his hands:
18392: Be it joy or be it sorrow
18393: He delays it till tomorrow,
18394: Waiting for the future, ever,        11465
18395: Finding his fulfilment, never.
18396: 
18397: Faust
18398: 
18399: Be gone! And don’t come near me!
18400: Such nonsense I’ll not understand.
18401: Away, with your evil litany,
18402: Sent to confuse the cleverest man!   11470
18403: 
18404: Care
18405: 
18406: Shall he come, or shall he go?
18407: All decision is denied him:
18408: In the middle of the road,
18409: He staggers, feeling round him.
18410: He’s ever more deeply lost,          11475
18411: Seeing everything star-crossed,
18412: Wearies himself and all the rest,
18413: Stifles as he holds his breath:
18414: Lifeless, but not yet gone under,
18415: Resists despair or surrender.        11480
18416: So, with an incessant rolling,
18417: A painful end, and hard going,
18418: Now free, and now constrained,
18419: In half sleep, poorly entertained,
18420: Confine him in a little space:                     11485
18421: Prepare him for Hell’s other place.
18422: 
18423: Faust
18424: 
18425: Unholy spectre! So you hand our race
18426: To the ravages of a thousand devils:
18427: Even transform our worthless days
18428: To a wretched knot of entangling evils.            11490
18429: It’s hard I know to free oneself from Demons,
18430: The strong spirit-bonds are not lightly broken:
18431: And yet, Care, I’ll not recognise you, nor even,
18432: That creeping power of yours, by any token.
18433: 
18434: Care
18435: 
18436: Feel it now, as on the wind,                       11495
18437: I, and my curse, depart, again.
18438: Lifelong, all you men are blind,
18439: Now, Faust, be so to the end!
18440: 
18441: (She breathes in his face, and departs.)
18442: 
18443: Faust (Now blind.)
18444: 
18445: The night seems deeper all around me,
18446: Only within me is there gleaming light:            11500
18447: I must finish what I’ve done, and hurry,
18448: The master’s word alone declares what’s right.
18449: Up from your beds, you slaves! Man on man!
18450: Reveal the daring of my favoured plan.
18451: Seize the tools: on with pick and spade!           11505
18452: Let the end-result be now displayed.
18453: Strict order, and swift industry
18454: Then the finest prize we’ll see:
18455: And so the greatest work may stand,
18456: One mind equal to a thousand hands.                11510
18457: Part II Act V Scene VI: The Great Outer Court of the Palace
18458: 
18459: (Torches.)
18460: 
18461: Mephistopheles (In advance, as Overseer.)
18462: 
18463: Come on! Come on! In here, in here!
18464: Quivering spirits of the dead,
18465: All you patchwork semi-natures,
18466: Sinew, bone, and tendon wed.
18467: 
18468: The Spirits of the Dead (Lemures, in Chorus.)
18469: 
18470: Swiftly now we are on hand                                    11515
18471: With half an impression,
18472: That it concerns a tract of land,
18473: Of which we’ll gain possession.
18474: Pointed stakes with us appear,
18475: Chains to measure ground on:                                  11520
18476: But why you’ve called us here
18477: Is something we’ve forgotten.
18478: 
18479: Mephistopheles
18480: 
18481: Artistic effort’s not the prize:
18482: Carry it out in your own manner!
18483: Lay the longest one of you lengthwise,                        11525
18484: Then pile the turf on him, you others.
18485: Do as they once did for our fathers there,
18486: Dig out a somewhat lengthened square!
18487: Gone from a palace to a narrow place:
18488: It’s still as stupid an end for man to face.                  11530
18489: 
18490: The Spirits of the Dead (Digging with mocking gestures.)
18491: 
18492: When I was young and lived and loved,
18493: I thought it was very sweet:
18494: To happy sounds, and cheerful steps,
18495: I lifted up my feet.
18496: Now treacherous old age has clawed                                   11535
18497: Me with his crutch, since when
18498: I stumble at the grave’s wide door,
18499: Why do they leave it open!
18500: 
18501: Faust (Comes from the Palace, groping his way past the doorposts.)
18502: 
18503: How the clattering of shovels cheers me!
18504: It’s the crews still labouring on,                                   11540
18505: Till earth is reconciled to man,
18506: The waves accept their boundaries,
18507: And ocean’s bound with iron bands.
18508: 
18509: Mephistopheles (Aside.)
18510: 
18511: And yet with all your walls and dams
18512: You’re merely dancing to our tune:                                   11545
18513: Since you prepare for our Neptune,
18514: The Water-demon, one vast feast.
18515: You’ll be lost in every way –
18516: The elements are ours, today,
18517: And ruin comes on running feet.                                      11550
18518: 
18519: Faust
18520: 
18521: Overseer!
18522: 
18523: Mephistopheles
18524: 
18525:             Here!
18526: 
18527: Faust
18528: 
18529:                   Any way you can
18530: Bring crowds of labourers together,
18531: Spurred by force or hope of pleasure,
18532: By pay, enticement or press-gang!
18533: Report to me on progress every day,                                  11555
18534: The depth of earth and gravel dug away.
18535: Mephistopheles (Half-aloud.)
18536: 
18537: Reporting it to me the word they gave,
18538: Was not quite gravel, it was more like – grave.
18539: 
18540: Faust
18541: 
18542: A swamp lies there below the hill,
18543: Infecting everything I’ve done:                       11560
18544: My last and greatest act of will
18545: Succeeds when that foul pool is gone.
18546: Let me make room for many a million,
18547: Not wholly secure, but free to work on.
18548: Green fertile fields, where men and herds             11565
18549: May gain swift comfort from the new-made earth.
18550: Quickly settled in those hills’ embrace,
18551: Piled high by a brave, industrious race.
18552: And in the centre here, a Paradise,
18553: Whose boundaries hold back the raging tide,           11570
18554: And though it gnaws to enter in by force,
18555: The common urge unites to halt its course.
18556: Yes, I’ve surrendered to this thought’s insistence,
18557: The last word Wisdom ever has to say:
18558: He only earns his Freedom and Existence,              11575
18559: Who’s forced to win them freshly every day.
18560: Childhood, manhood, age’s vigorous years,
18561: Surrounded by dangers, they’ll spend here.
18562: I wish to gaze again on such a land,
18563: Free earth: where a free race, in freedom, stand.     11580
18564: Then, to the Moment I’d dare say:
18565: ‘Stay a while! You are so lovely!’
18566: Through aeons, then, never to fade away
18567: This path of mine through all that’s earthly. –
18568: Anticipating, here, its deep enjoyment,               11585
18569: Now I savour it, that highest moment.
18570: (Faust sinks back, the spirits of the dead take him and lay him on the
18571: ground.)
18572: 
18573: Mephistopheles
18574: 
18575: No bliss satisfied him, no enjoyment,
18576: And so he tried to catch at shifting forms:
18577: The last, the worst, the emptiest of moments,
18578: He wished to hold at last in his arms.                                   11590
18579: Though against me he tried to stand,
18580: Time is master: age lies on the sand.
18581: The clock stands still –
18582: 
18583: Chorus
18584: 
18585: Stands still! As midnight: silent.
18586: The hand moves.
18587: 
18588: Mephistopheles
18589: 
18590: It falls, and all is spent.
18591: 
18592: Chorus
18593: 
18594: It’s past.
18595: 
18596: Mephistopheles
18597: 
18598:         Past! A stupid word.                                             11595
18599: Then, why?
18600: Past, and pure nothing, complete monotony!
18601: What use is this eternal creation!
18602: Creating, to achieve annihilation!
18603: ‘There, it’s past!’ What’s to read in it?                                11600
18604: It’s just the same as if it never lived,
18605: Yet chases round in circles, as if it did.
18606: I’d prefer to have the everlasting void.
18607: Burial
18608: 
18609: A Spirit of the Dead (Solo.)
18610: 
18611: Who’s built the house so badly,
18612: With shovel and with spade?                          11605
18613: 
18614: Spirits of the Dead (Chorus.)
18615: 
18616: For you dull guest, in hempen dress,
18617: It was all too carefully made.
18618: 
18619: A Spirit of the Dead (Solo.)
18620: 
18621: Who’s decked the hall so badly?
18622: Where now the table and chairs?
18623: 
18624: Spirits of the Dead (Chorus.)
18625: 
18626: Borrowed for a little while:                         11610
18627: There are many creditors.
18628: 
18629: Mephistopheles
18630: 
18631: The body’s here: if the spirit tries to fly,
18632: I’ll show it my blood-signed title swiftly:
18633: Yet men have found so many methods, sadly,
18634: To cheat the Devil of their souls, or try.           11615
18635: We carry on the same old way,
18636: New ones aren’t recommended:
18637: I used to work alone: today
18638: I have to use the help extended.
18639: And everything goes badly too!                       11620
18640: Ancient right, traditional use,
18641: One can’t rely on those much longer.
18642: At the last breath, once, the soul was out,
18643: I slipped by, and like the swiftest mouse,
18644: Caught her! Held her fast, my claws were stronger.   11625
18645: Now she lingers, won’t leave the gloomy place,
18646: The foul corpse’s hideous house, until
18647: The elements force her, in hatred still,
18648: And drive her out at last, in disgrace.
18649: And though the hour and minute plague me,              11630
18650: ‘When’, ‘how’ and ‘where’, still the tiresome query:
18651: Old Death has lost his ancient power,
18652: ‘Whether’ is doubtful, never mind the hour:
18653: Often, with lust, I saw the rigid frame
18654: It was a sham: it stirred, and rose again.             11635
18655: 
18656: (He makes fantastic, whirling conjuring gestures.)
18657: 
18658: Now quick! Redouble your paces, too,
18659: You gentlemen, straight or twisted-horned,
18660: The old Devil’s grain and kernel born,
18661: And bring Hell’s jaws along with you.
18662: True Hell has many jaws! Yes, many!                    11640
18663: To swallow according to standing and worth:
18664: However in this last game of all we’re ready
18665: To be a little less considerate, henceforth.
18666: 
18667: (The fearful jaws of Hell open on the left.)
18668: 
18669: The tusks yawn wide: the jaws of the abyss,
18670: Flow with raging flames, in fury,                      11645
18671: And in the boiling background hiss,
18672: I see the eternal glow of the fiery city.
18673: The crimson tide breaks against the teeth,
18674: The damned in hope of help swim through:
18675: But the vast hyena mangles them beneath,               11650
18676: And sends them to new anguish in the brew.
18677: There are many corners to discover,
18678: So many horrors in such little room!
18679: You’ve done quite well at frightening sinners,
18680: But still they think it dream, deceit, untrue.         11655
18681: 
18682: (To the fat devils with short straight horns.)
18683: 
18684: Now, you fat-bellied rascals with fiery cheeks!
18685: You’ve grown that way eating hellish sulphur:
18686: Stumpy, short, with thick immoveable necks!
18687: Watch below, for any glow of phosphor:
18688: That’s the soul, Psyche with the wings,          11660
18689: Pluck them off and she’s a nasty worm:
18690: I’ll stamp her with my signature, first thing,
18691: Then off with her to the whirling fiery storm!
18692: Pass on towards the nether regions,
18693: You barrels, since all that’s your duty:         11665
18694: Whether she lives there, that’s the notion,
18695: None know with any accuracy.
18696: She’ll gladly lodge in the navel –
18697: Lest she slip away from there, be careful.
18698: 
18699: (To the lean devils with long crooked horns.)
18700: 
18701: You, clowns, you giant flying creatures,         11670
18702: Grasp at the air: grant yourselves no rest!
18703: Your strong arms and sharp-clawed features,
18704: Are sure to hold the fluttering fugitive fast.
18705: She’s stuck there inside her ancient house,
18706: And Spirit will always look for a way out.       11675
18707: 
18708: (Glory from above, on the right.)
18709: 
18710: The Heavenly Host
18711: 
18712: Messengers follow
18713: Heavenly kin, oh,
18714: In leisurely flight:
18715: Sin they forgive,
18716: Dust they make live:                             11680
18717: The friendship they show
18718: To Nature below,
18719: Floating they’ll give,
18720: As they slowly alight!
18721: 
18722: Mephistopheles
18723: 
18724: I hear discords, all that nasty jingling,        11685
18725: Coming from up there, with unwelcome day:
18726: It’s always that childish, girlish bungling,
18727: That pious taste loves to hear and play.
18728: You know how we in despicable moments,
18729: Considered the ruin of the human race:                  11690
18730: But the most shameful of compliments,
18731: Is that their prayers are a worse disgrace.
18732: These dandies come, the hypocrites:
18733: They’ve snatched a heap of souls away,
18734: Use our own weapons too to do it:                       11695
18735: They’re Devils in disguise, I’d say.
18736: To lose this one is everlasting shame:
18737: On to the grave, and renew your claim!
18738: 
18739: The Choir of Angels (Scattering roses)
18740: 
18741: Roses, you dazzling ones,
18742: Balsam you’re sending us,                               11700
18743: Floating and trembling,
18744: Secretly quickening,
18745: Branches inspiring us,
18746: Buds sweetly firing us,
18747: Hasten to bloom!                                        11705
18748: Crimson and green, here
18749: Springtime assume!
18750: Carry the sleeper
18751: To Paradise’ room.
18752: 
18753: Mephistopheles (To the devils.)
18754: 
18755: Why duck and dive? Is that Hell’s custom?               11710
18756: Stand still, and let them do their scattering.
18757: Every gawk in place, and face them!
18758: They think with such a flowery smattering,
18759: To cool the heat of devils’ chattering:
18760: At your breath it melts and shrinks, again.             11715
18761: Now blow, you blowers! – Enough, enough!
18762: Your bubbling’s faded all that stuff. –
18763: Not so fiercely! Close your mouths and noses!
18764: Ah, now you’ve been too violent with the roses,
18765: Where’s the moderation you should have learnt?          11720
18766: They’re not just shrivelling: they’re burning, burnt!
18767: They float about in flames, poisonous, bright:
18768: Avoid them: close together, huddle tight! –
18769: Your power’s waning! And your courage too!
18770: The devils sniff the strange, seductive brew.         11725
18771: 
18772: The Choir of Angels
18773: 
18774: Blossoms, of joyfulness,
18775: Flames, of true happiness,
18776: Love, they radiate,
18777: Bliss, they now create,
18778: As the heart may.                                     11730
18779: Words that are truest,
18780: Air of the clearest,
18781: Gathering round us
18782: Eternal day!
18783: 
18784: Mephistopheles
18785: 
18786: O, curses! O shower of shame that’s shed!             11735
18787: Each Satan’s standing on his head,
18788: The Fatties spin like tops, in curves,
18789: And plunge arse-upwards into Hell.
18790: Go find the hot baths you deserve!
18791: While at my post I’ll stand here still. –             11740
18792: 
18793: (He beats at the hovering roses.)
18794: 
18795: Will-o’-the wisps, be gone! Though you burn bright,
18796: Snatched at, in the end, you’re disgusting shite.
18797: Why’d you keep fluttering here? Buzz off! –
18798: They stick like tar and sulphur: filthy stuff.
18799: 
18800: The Choir of Angels
18801: 
18802: What is not part of you,                              11745
18803: You need not share it:
18804: What inwardly troubles you,
18805: You need not bear it.
18806: Should it close in, with force,
18807: We will deflect its course.                             11750
18808: Only the loving, Love
18809: Guides to its source!
18810: 
18811: Mephistopheles
18812: 
18813: My head and heart are burnt: my liver’s burnt,
18814: By a devilish element!
18815: Sharper than the fires of Hell! –                       11755
18816: That’s what makes you cry, so, as well,
18817: You, the unlucky in love! Disdained,
18818: Heads turned to the beloved, strained.
18819: Mine, too! What’s twisted it to one side?
18820: Are they and I not sworn to eternal strife?             11760
18821: I, once fiercely hostile to their very sight.
18822: Has an alien force pierced me through and through?
18823: I gladly gaze at them, loveliest of youths:
18824: What holds me back from cursing at the light? –
18825: And if I let myself be seduced,                         11765
18826: Who’ll play the fool in future?
18827: These airy fellows that I hate, too,
18828: How lovely to me now they all appear! –
18829: You sweet children, tell me then:
18830: Aren’t you part of Lucifer’s race?                      11770
18831: You’re so nice I’d like to kiss you, and again,
18832: It feels as if this is your proper place.
18833: It feels as comfortable, as natural to me,
18834: As if we’d met a thousand times before:
18835: So surreptitiously catlike, so lustfully:               11775
18836: The loveliness with each glance quickens more.
18837: Oh, come nearer: Oh, only glance at me!
18838: 
18839: The Angels
18840: 
18841: We’re here already, why so cautiously?
18842: We are close, and, if you can, then stay!
18843: 
18844: (The Angels come forward and occupy the whole space.)
18845: Mephistopheles (Crowded into the proscenium.)
18846: 
18847: You scorn us, the spirits of the damned,          11780
18848: Yet you’re of the true Sorcerers’ brand:
18849: You lead both man and wife astray. –
18850: What wretched luck, and dire!
18851: Is this Love’s own element?
18852: My whole body’s bathed in fire,                   11785
18853: I scarcely feel, my head’s so burnt. –
18854: You float to and fro, sink down a while,
18855: Move your sweet limbs with earthly guile:
18856: True, a grave expression suits you well,
18857: But I’d still like to see you smile a little!     11790
18858: That would be an eternal delight to me.
18859: Like the lovers’ mutual glance, you see:
18860: A simper round the mouth, is how it’s done,
18861: You, the tall lad, you could make me love you,
18862: The priest’s pose doesn’t really suit you,        11795
18863: So show a little lust, and look hereon!
18864: You could be more modestly naked too,
18865: That robe’s long hem, so demure in its rising –
18866: They turn away – and seen from the rear view –
18867: Those rascals now are really appetising!          11800
18868: 
18869: The Choir of Angels
18870: 
18871: You, loving fires,
18872: Brighter, now, fanned,
18873: Heal the damned,
18874: With Truth, the higher!
18875: Let them be freed                                 11805
18876: From evil indeed,
18877: Blissfully grace,
18878: The eternal embrace.
18879: Mephistopheles (Collecting himself.)
18880: 
18881: What’s happening to me! – Like Job, in fact
18882: All boils: so I scare myself, and yet I’ve won           11810
18883: As well, since, now my inspection’s done,
18884: And my trust in self and tribe’s well placed,
18885: The Devil’s noble bits appear intact,
18886: This love-bewitchment’s only on the surface:
18887: The wretched flames already smother,                     11815
18888: And, as is right, I curse you all together!
18889: 
18890: The Choir of Angels
18891: 
18892: Pure incandescence!
18893: Whom its flames bless,
18894: Blissful with goodness,
18895: Is their existence.                                      11820
18896: Gathered together,
18897: Rise now, and praise!
18898: Spirit can breathe here,
18899: In purer waves!
18900: 
18901: (They rise, carrying away the immortal part of Faust.)
18902: 
18903: Mephistopheles (Looking round him.)
18904: 
18905: How then? – Where did they vanish to?                    11825
18906: You took me by surprise, you adolescents.
18907: Now with what they’ve salvaged from the tomb,
18908: As their own prize, they’ve flown off to heaven:
18909: They’ve stolen a great, a unique treasure:
18910: That noble soul, mortgaged to my pleasure,               11830
18911: They’ve snatched it away, with cunning even.
18912: But whom could I complain to, anyway?
18913: Who’d grant me my well-earned right?
18914: You’ve been swindled in your old age,
18915: You’ve deserved it, this wretched slight.                11835
18916: At great expense, shameful! And it’s gone:
18917: I’ve mishandled it all disgracefully,
18918: A common lust, an absurd passion,
18919: Swayed the hardened devil foolishly.
18920: And if Experience was in a mess,            11840
18921: With all these childish, stupid things,
18922: It was, in truth, no trivial Foolishness,
18923: That took possession of him in the end.
18924: Part II Act V Scene VII: Mountain Gorges, Forest, Rock, Desert
18925: 
18926: (Holy Hermits, divided in ascending planes, posted among the ravines.)
18927: 
18928: Chorus and Echo
18929: 
18930: Forests, they wave around,
18931: Over them, cliffs bear down,                                        11845
18932: Roots cling to rocky ground,
18933: Trunk upon trunk is bound,
18934: Wave after wave sprays up,
18935: Deep caves protecting us.
18936: Lions prowl silently,                                               11850
18937: Round us, still friendly,
18938: Honouring sacred space,
18939: Love’s holy hiding place.
18940: 
18941: Pater Ecstaticus (Hovering up and down.)
18942: 
18943: Eternal, fire of bliss,
18944: Glow of love’s bond this is,                                        11855
18945: Pain in the heart, seething,
18946: Rapture divine, foaming.
18947: Arrows, come, piercing me,
18948: Spears, compelling me,
18949: Clubs, you may shatter me,                                          11860
18950: Lightning may flash through me!
18951: So passes the nullity
18952: Of all unreality,
18953: And from the lasting star
18954: Shines Love’s eternal core.                                         11865
18955: 
18956: Pater Profundis (At a lower level.)
18957: 
18958: As this rocky abyss at my feet,
18959: Rests on a deeper abyss,
18960: As a thousand glittering streams meet
18961: In the foaming flood’s downward hiss,
18962: As with its own strong impulse, above,                              11870
18963: The tree lifts skywards in the air:
18964: Even so all-powerful love,
18965: Creates all things, in its care.
18966: Around me there’s a savage roar,
18967: As if the rocks and forests sway,            11875
18968: Yet full of love the waters pour,
18969: Rushing bountifully away,
18970: Sent to irrigate the valley here:
18971: The lightning that flashed down,
18972: Must purify the atmosphere,                  11880
18973: With poisonous vapours bound –
18974: They are love’s messengers, they tell
18975: Of what creates eternally around us.
18976: May it inflame me inwardly, as well,
18977: Since my spirit, cold and confounded,        11885
18978: Torments itself, bound in the dull senses,
18979: As sharp-toothed fetters’ agonising art.
18980: Oh, God! Calm my thoughts, pacify us,
18981: And bring light to my needy heart!
18982: 
18983: Pater Seraphicus (In the middle regions.)
18984: 
18985: What a mist of morning hovers                11890
18986: Through the pine-trees’ swaying hair!
18987: Can I guess what it might cover?
18988: A crowd of spirits live there.
18989: 
18990: Choir of Sacred Young Boys
18991: 
18992: Tell us, Father, where we wander,
18993: Tell us, Kind One, who we are?               11895
18994: We are happy: Being’s tender
18995: To all who are, all who are.
18996: 
18997: Pater Seraphicus
18998: 
18999: Young boys! Born at midnight’s hour,
19000: Mind and spirit half-unveiled,
19001: For your parents, a lost dower,              11900
19002: For the angels, profit gained.
19003: You can feel that one who loves
19004: Is near to you, so come to me:
19005: Yet of earthly ways and moves,
19006: You bear no traces, happily.                                   11905
19007: Rise into my eyes, those known
19008: Organs of the earthly life,
19009: You can use them as your own,
19010: Gaze at all the spaces wide!
19011: 
19012: (He absorbs them into himself.)
19013: 
19014: Those are trees: those are cliffs,                             11910
19015: A stream of water, rushing round,
19016: With gigantic leaps it lifts,
19017: Shortening its journey down.
19018: 
19019: The Young Boys (From within him.)
19020: 
19021: That’s indeed a mighty vision,
19022: But it’s gloomy here, you know,                                11915
19023: With fear and dread we’re all shaken.
19024: Father, Kind one, let us go!
19025: 
19026: Pater Seraphicus
19027: 
19028: Rise upwards to the highest sphere,
19029: Grow unnoticed there forever,
19030: While in pure eternal manner,                                  11920
19031: God’s presence makes you stronger.
19032: Such is the spirit’s libation,
19033: Blending with the freest air:
19034: Love’s eternal revelation,
19035: Bliss is unfolded there.                                       11925
19036: 
19037: The Choir of Young Boys (Circling round the highest summit.)
19038: 
19039: Hands now entwining,
19040: Joyfully circling round,
19041: Soaring and singing
19042: With sacred feeling’s sound!
19043: In the divinely taught,                                        11930
19044: Now you should trust:
19045: He whom your worship sought
19046: You’ll see at last.
19047: 
19048: The Angels (Soaring in the highest atmosphere, carrying the immortal part
19049: of Faust.)
19050: 
19051: He’s escaped, this noble member
19052: Of the spirit world, from evil,                                     11935
19053: Whoever strives, in his endeavour,
19054: We can rescue from the devil.
19055: And if he has Love within,
19056: Granted from above,
19057: The sacred crowd will meet him,                                     11940
19058: With welcome, and with love.
19059: 
19060: The Younger Angels
19061: 
19062: Every rose from the hands
19063: Of those penitents, loving, holy,
19064: Helped us win the victory,
19065: The highest work, completed, stands,                                11945
19066: The treasure of this soul we’ve won.
19067: Evil bowed to petals thrown,
19068: Devils fled the blows we threw.
19069: Instead of Hell’s hurts anew,
19070: They felt spirits’ loving pain:                                     11950
19071: Pierced with agony again
19072: The old devil-master too was gone.
19073: Shout with joy! All is done.
19074: 
19075: The More Perfect Angels
19076: 
19077: Carrying earthly remains
19078: Is hard to endure,                                                  11955
19079: Though they survive the flames,
19080: They are still the impure.
19081: Once a great spirit’s strength
19082: So tightly fits
19083: All the four elements,                                              11960
19084: No angel splits
19085: That double nature wed,
19086: The inwardly binding:
19087: To Eternal Love instead
19088: Is left the unwinding.                                                 11965
19089: 
19090: The Younger Angels
19091: 
19092: Misted on rocky heights
19093: Now we are feeling,
19094: Nearing our clearer sight
19095: Spiritual Being.
19096: These clouds are vanishing                                             11970
19097: A crowd I see, moving,
19098: Of sacred young men,
19099: Freed from their earthly gloom,
19100: Circling together,
19101: Delighting again,                                                      11975
19102: In the spring’s brighter bloom,
19103: In higher air.
19104: Let them together then,
19105: Lead him on: risen,
19106: Perfect, and there!                                                    11980
19107: 
19108: The Young Boys
